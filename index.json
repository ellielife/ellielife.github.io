[{"categories":null,"contents":"Welcome to the Mainroad theme documentation. This quick start guide covers Mainroad theme installation and minimal configuration and is intended for intermediate to advanced users. To understand this guide, you need to be familiar with the Hugo static site generator.\nInstallation Before installing the Mainroad theme, make sure that you\u0026rsquo;ve installed Hugo (version 0.54.0 or later) and created a new site. To learn how to install Hugo, visit Hugo Documentation.\nThere are a few ways to install a theme in Hugo. This can be done via git submodule, git clone, Hugo modules, or by downloading the archive and manually copying the files. Three installation options are described below.\nOption A: git submodule Additional requirements: git\nIf you don\u0026rsquo;t plan to make significant changes to the theme but still want to track and update it, you can add it as a git submodule by running the following command from the root directory of your Hugo site:\ngit submodule add https://github.com/vimux/mainroad.git themes/mainroad Note: Netlify expects git submodule instead of git clone.\nOption B: git clone Additional requirements: git\nRun this git clone command from the root of your Hugo site:\ngit clone https://github.com/vimux/mainroad.git themes/mainroad Option C: Manual install If you do not want to use git, you can manually download ZIP and extract it into the themes/mainroad within your Hugo site.\nActivate theme Whichever installation option you choose, don\u0026rsquo;t forget to edit theme param of the site configuration config.toml:\ntheme = \u0026#34;mainroad\u0026#34; To check it out, build the site via hugo command or make it available on a local server via hugo server.\nMinimal configuration Do not copy the example config as-is. Use only the parameters that you need. The Mainroad theme contains required defaults, so you don\u0026rsquo;t need to add all of the configuration parameters to run the theme for the first time. Before adding any theme-specific parameters, make sure to edit the theme param inside the config file and check that the theme works.\nFor information about common customization settings, see Customization page. To view our example configuration, visit demo config.\nEdit this page on GitHub\n","permalink":"https://ellielife.github.io/docs/getting-started/","tags":["Installation"],"title":"Getting started"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Customization page describes common Mainroad configuration parameters which can be specified via configuration file or via Front Matter section. That includes logo section tuning, adding a sidebar with widgets, adjusting highlight color, and more.\nThis section will mainly cover customization settings that are unique to this theme. If something is not covered here, there\u0026rsquo;s a good chance it is covered somewhere in Hugo docs.\nLogo Mainroad allows you to set a custom logo in the site header. You may use text, or image, or both. Use the following options in your site config:\n[Params.logo] image = \u0026#34;img/placeholder.png\u0026#34; title = \u0026#34;Mainroad\u0026#34; subtitle = \u0026#34;Just another site\u0026#34; Note: logo image will display at a maximum width of 128 pixels and a maximum height of 128 pixels when you use text and image simultaneously. When the only logo image is active, it will display at a maximum height of 256 pixels. Ideally, your logo image should be SVG.\nIf you don\u0026rsquo;t set any of these variables, the theme uses the site title as a logo title. Don\u0026rsquo;t need a logo section? Disable it this way:\n[Params.logo] image = false title = false subtitle = false Highlight color Mainroad uses #e22d30 as a default highlight color, but you may choose and set any other color.\n[Params.style.vars] highlightColor = \u0026#34;#e22d30\u0026#34; Post meta Post meta is a feature that refers to including additional meta information (such as author name, categories, date, translations, etc.) on pages. It can be enabled via config using the post_meta key with a list of meta field names as value. Order matters here: rearrange fields if you want to.\n[Params] post_meta = [\u0026#34;author\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;date\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;categories\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;translations\u0026#34;] Full list of available default post meta fields:\nauthor, categories, date, translations In addition to the default meta fields, you can add your own by placing a custom partial under layouts/partials/post_meta/\u0026lt;name\u0026gt;.html.\nPost meta: date localization With Hugo v0.87.0 (or later), date meta field shows localized dates (with weekdays and months in the current language) by default. In most cases, such a transition is painless, but owners of multilingual sites should be careful and check that everything translates as expected after the upgrade.\nYou can also use a predefined layout, like :date_full, and it will output localized dates or times. For additional information about localized dates and possible date/time formatting layouts, please see Hugo: time.Format.\nThumbnail visibility By default, a thumbnail image has shown for a list and single pages simultaneously. In some cases, you may want to show a thumbnail for list-like pages only and hide it on single pages (or vice versa). Control global thumbnail visibility via config, use the key visibility with combination of valid values \u0026quot;list\u0026quot; and \u0026quot;post\u0026quot;.\n[Params.thumbnail] # Show thumbnail only for list items visibility = [\u0026#34;list\u0026#34;] Besides global configuration, you can change thumbnail visibility individually with extended thumbnail notation via front matter block.\nthumbnail: src: \u0026#34;img/placeholder.png\u0026#34; visibility: - list - post This page is an example of list-only thumbnail visibility.\nSidebar Mainroad comes with a configurable sidebar that can be on the left, on the right, or disabled. The default layout can be specified in the [Params.sidebar] section of the configuration. The position can be specified for home, list and single pages individually. Use the keys home, list and single with values \u0026quot;left\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;right\u0026quot; or false.\n[Params.sidebar] home = \u0026#34;right\u0026#34; list = \u0026#34;right\u0026#34; single = \u0026#34;right\u0026#34; The layout can be configured per page, by setting the sidebar parameter with one of the same values (\u0026quot;left\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;right\u0026quot; or false) in the page\u0026rsquo;s front matter.\nsidebar: \u0026#34;left\u0026#34; # Enable sidebar (on the left side) per page The sidebar consists of multiple widgets. Widgets can be enabled individually using the widgets key with a list of widget names as value. You can add your own widgets, by placing a template under layouts/partials/widgets/\u0026lt;name\u0026gt;.html.\n[Params.sidebar] # Enable widgets in given order widgets = [\u0026#34;search\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;recent\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;categories\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;taglist\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;social\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;languages\u0026#34;] The list of widgets can be overwritten from a page\u0026rsquo;s front matter.\n# Enable sidebar widgets in given order widgets: - \u0026#34;search\u0026#34; - \u0026#34;recent\u0026#34; - \u0026#34;taglist\u0026#34; Full list of available default widgets:\nsearch, ddg-search, recent, categories, taglist, social, languages Note: DuckDuckGo widget (ddg-search) deprecated in favor of search widget.\nSome of our widgets respect optional configuration. Have a look at the [Params.widgets] and [Params.widgets.social] sections in the example below.\n[Params.widgets] recent_num = 5 # Set the number of articles in the \u0026#34;Recent articles\u0026#34; widget categories_counter = false # Enable counter for each category in \u0026#34;Categories\u0026#34; widget tags_counter = false # Enable counter for each tag in \u0026#34;Tags\u0026#34; widget [Params.widgets.social] # Enable parts of social widget facebook = \u0026#34;username\u0026#34; twitter = \u0026#34;username\u0026#34; instagram = \u0026#34;username\u0026#34; linkedin = \u0026#34;username\u0026#34; telegram = \u0026#34;username\u0026#34; github = \u0026#34;username\u0026#34; gitlab = \u0026#34;username\u0026#34; bitbucket = \u0026#34;username\u0026#34; email = \u0026#34;example@example.com\u0026#34; Widget caching Sidebar strongly affects overall build time, especially if you are using all of our widgets or even more. Widget caching can significantly improve the generation time. Cached partials remain the same for all affected pages and are not generated multiple times by Hugo. All built-in widgets (search, recent, categories, taglist, social, languages) support caching.\nAdd cached = true inside the corresponding widget\u0026rsquo;s dictionary table to activate caching. For example, to cache the recent widget:\n[Params.widgets.recent] cached = true The following sample configuration extract shows how to cache all standard widgets and generate your website faster:\n[Params.widgets.search] cached = true [Params.widgets.recent] cached = true [Params.widgets.categories] cached = true [Params.widgets.taglist] cached = true [Params.widgets.social] cached = true [Params.widgets.languages] cached = true Not all widgets are cacheable. If a widget contains (can contain) different data for different pages (e.g., for TOC generation), then it should not be cached. Always check that your modified/customized widget is cached correctly.\nSocial Widget: custom links Mainroad contains built-in social links in the social widget. In addition to default social links, you may set custom links by adding Params.widgets.social.custom to your config.toml. Here is an example:\n[[Params.widgets.social.custom]] title = \u0026#34;My Home Page\u0026#34; url = \u0026#34;https://example.com\u0026#34; If you want to display an icon of your social link, you need to put SVG icon file in layouts/partials directory under your site\u0026rsquo;s root. The icon key filed, which is optional, should be a path relative to layouts/partials.\n[[Params.widgets.social.custom]] title = \u0026#34;Youtube\u0026#34; url = \u0026#34;https://youtube.com/user/username\u0026#34; icon = \u0026#34;youtube.svg\u0026#34; Note: Only SVG files are supported to be used as custom social icons. If you use any other files, PNG for example, a compile error will be raised by Hugo. Moreover, not every SVG icon can be used. For better results, it should be one-color SVG file with a special class attribute {{ with .class }}{{ . }} {{ end }} and 24x24 size. At a minimum, custom SVG icon needs these attributes:\n\u0026lt;svg class=\u0026#34;{{ with .class }}{{ . }} {{ end }} icon\u0026#34; width=\u0026#34;24\u0026#34; height=\u0026#34;24\u0026#34;\u0026gt;...\u0026lt;/svg\u0026gt; You can also specify the rel attribute for the link. By default, the attribute value is \u0026quot;noopener noreferrer\u0026quot;. You can remove the attribute completely by setting its value to false.\n[[Params.widgets.social.custom]] title = \u0026#34;My Home Page\u0026#34; url = \u0026#34;https://example.com\u0026#34; rel = \u0026#34;me\u0026#34; [[Params.widgets.social.custom]] title = \u0026#34;Youtube\u0026#34; url = \u0026#34;https://youtube.com/user/username\u0026#34; rel = false Search box widget The search box widget can refer to the results of Google, Bing, and DuckDuckGo searches. By default, Mainroad uses Google search if no additional configuration options are specified.\nTo use a different search engine, first of all, check that the search widget is enabled. Then set the search parameters (Site.Params.widgets.search section) according to the data below.\nGoogle (default):\n[Params.widgets.search] url = \u0026#34;https://google.com/search\u0026#34; [Params.widgets.search.input] name = \u0026#34;sitesearch\u0026#34; pre = \u0026#34;\u0026#34; DuckDuckGo:\n[Params.widgets.search] url = \u0026#34;https://duckduckgo.com/\u0026#34; [Params.widgets.search.input] name = \u0026#34;sites\u0026#34; pre = \u0026#34;\u0026#34; Bing:\n[Params.widgets.search] url = \u0026#34;https://www.bing.com/search\u0026#34; [Params.widgets.search.input] name = \u0026#34;q1\u0026#34; pre = \u0026#34;site:\u0026#34; Google PSE:\n[Params.widgets.search] url = \u0026#34;/search/\u0026#34; [Params.widgets.search.input] name = false pre = \u0026#34;\u0026#34; Note that Google PSE requires additional steps to work correctly. See Creating a Programmable Search Engine and especially our FAQ for more instructions.\nMenus Mainroad supports multiple menus. The main menu is fully responsive and displayed right under the site header. The secondary menus side and footer are displayed in a sidebar widget and the page footer respectively. To add a page to a menu, add a menu: \u0026lt;menu\u0026gt; parameter to the page\u0026rsquo;s front matter:\nmenu: main # Add page to a main menu Note: Don\u0026rsquo;t forget to enable the sidemenu widget in the widgets configuration param if you want to use the side menu.\nYou can also add a page to multiple menus by providing a list:\n# Add page to a main, side, and footer menu menu: - main - side - footer Note: Please keep in mind that Mainroad menus don\u0026rsquo;t support nested items i.e. submenus.\nSee Menus from official Hugo documentation for more info.\nCustom Google Fonts support Mainroad uses Open Sans from Google Fonts as a main font. But you can use any other font from Google Fonts if you\u0026rsquo;d like. Beware, in most cases, such changes require manual CSS adjustment because every set of fonts is different and might not look as good as our default font.\nFollow the procedure below.\nOpen Google Fonts, choose font(s) that you prefer and copy href font link. For this particular example, we choose Roboto with 3 different styles. Our href font link:\nhttps://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Roboto:ital,wght@0,400;0,700;1,400\u0026amp;display=swap Set googleFontsLink site\u0026rsquo;s config param value to your href font link. For example:\n[Params] googleFontsLink = \u0026#34;https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Roboto:ital,wght@0,400;0,700;1,400\u0026amp;display=swap\u0026#34; Override default font-family set(s):\n[Params.style.vars] fontFamilyPrimary = \u0026#34;\u0026#39;Roboto\u0026#39;, sans-serif\u0026#34; It is possible to disable Google Fonts and use system font stack instead.\nDisable Google Fonts include. Set googleFontsLink site\u0026rsquo;s config param value to false:\n[Params] googleFontsLink = false Override font-family sets:\n[Params.style.vars] # Override font-family sets. Take care of different quotes OR escaping symbols in these params if necessary fontFamilyPrimary = \u0026#34;system-ui, -apple-system, \u0026#39;Segoe UI\u0026#39;, Roboto, \u0026#39;Helvetica Neue\u0026#39;, Arial, \u0026#39;Noto Sans\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Liberation Sans\u0026#39;, sans-serif, \u0026#39;Apple Color Emoji\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Segoe UI Emoji\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Segoe UI Symbol\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Noto Color Emoji\u0026#39;\u0026#34; # Secondary font-family set responsible for pre, code, kbd, and samp tags font fontFamilySecondary = \u0026#34;SFMono-Regular, Menlo, Monaco, Consolas, \u0026#39;Liberation Mono\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Courier New\u0026#39;, monospace\u0026#34; Edit this page on GitHub\n","permalink":"https://ellielife.github.io/docs/customization/","tags":null,"title":"Customization"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Browse this FAQ page to find answers to frequently asked questions that have not been covered elsewhere in the documentation.\nThe answers have been categorized into two groups:\nAnswers to general questions without any lines of code. Answers to technical questions with code snippets, step-by-step instructions, etc. General questions Do I need to have prior experience before proceeding with the Mainroad theme? Yes. You\u0026rsquo;ll need to be familiar with Hugo before proceeding. Our docs section is intended for intermediate to advanced users and developers. Our documentation may still be helpful to users with minimal experience, but are not comprehensive.\nDo I need to use the extended version of Hugo? No. Mainroad theme intentionally does not use any features of the extended version. As such, the extended version of Hugo is not required (but applicable).\nIs there a list of all possible configuration options? Configuration:\nSee All Configuration Settings for the full list of Hugo-defined variables with their default values. See Mainroad config.toml example for the full list of Mainroad-specific variables. Front Matter:\nSee Front Matter Variables for the list of Hugo-defined Front Matter variables. See Mainroad Front Matter example for the list of Mainroad-specific Front Matter variables. What if I have more questions? Should I create an issue? We don\u0026rsquo;t provide personal technical support. As stated in our contributing guidelines, please do not use the issue tracker for personal support. This includes reports like: “How do I do this\u0026quot;, “Everything is broken; help me”, “I changed something, and it doesn\u0026rsquo;t work anymore”, “It\u0026rsquo;s not a personal issue, but I just want to ask how X or Y works”, “I forked your theme, then something broke; fix this immediately”, and so on.\nThe issue tracker should only be used for bug reports, feature requests, and discussions that comply with our contributing rules. All other issues will be closed and marked as invalid.\nTechnical questions I want to get the favicon.ico and apple-touch-icon.png to match my hightlightColor. What should I do? There is no way to do this on the fly with Hugo, but you can use the one-liners below with some preparations:\nCopy: ./themes/mainroad/static/favicon.ico to ./static/favicon.ico ./themes/mainroad/static/apple-touch-icon.png to ./static/apple-touch-icon.png At the beginning of each script, replace the color in the variable with your preferred color. You must use six-digit hex triplet notation (e.g., #E22D30) to make it work properly. Go to the root of your project directory in the terminal and execute these two commands accordingly.\na=#E22D30;a=\\\\x${a:5:2}\\\\x${a:3:2}\\\\x${a:1:2};for i in 98 274 578;do printf $a|dd of=static/favicon.ico bs=1 seek=$i conv=notrunc;done a=#E22D30;a=$(echo 504C54452A2A2A${a:1:6}|sed -e \u0026#39;s/../\\\\x\u0026amp;/g\u0026#39;);printf $a|gzip|tail -c8|od -tx4 -N4 -An|xargs|sed -e \u0026#39;s/../\\\\x\u0026amp;/g\u0026#39;|printf $a$(cat -)|dd of=static/apple-touch-icon.png bs=1 seek=37 conv=notrunc I want to use Google Programmable Search Engine as a site search engine. Is it possible? Yes, it is possible to use Google PSE (CSE) as a site search engine.\nCreate a new search engine with Google PSE. Google account required.\nAdd a new layout.\nCreate file ./layouts/search/index.html with the following content:\n{{ define \u0026#34;main\u0026#34; }} \u0026lt;script async src=\u0026#34;https://cse.google.com/cse.js?cx=YOUR_PSE_ENGINE_ID\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div class=\u0026#34;gcse-search\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; {{ end }} Don\u0026rsquo;t forget to paste your Google PSE ID.\nAdd search page by creating file ./content/search.md with the following content:\n--- title: Search authorbox: false sidebar: false pager: false --- Optional. If you use the search widget, don\u0026rsquo;t forget to change the search box parameters:\n[Params.widgets.search] url = \u0026#34;/search/\u0026#34; input.name = false input.pre = \u0026#34;\u0026#34; Google PSE (CSE) should work when it\u0026rsquo;s done.

Liberto\n有興趣可以去看看唷~\n感想 看完這段視頻後，我很高興自己並不孤單，原來這世上還有人跟我很類似，我猜這位小哥跟我一樣很享受獨處的時光，好這是題外話，事實上他分享的內容跟我的Boss一直在告訴我的內容是一樣的，祂要我去學習聆聽內在的聲音，也就是深度的自我對話，祂告訴我：『我們每個人內在都有指南針，事實上你們並不需要其他人來告訴你應該怎麼做，因為一切答案都在自己的內心，唯有從內在開始改變，你的外在實相才會\u0026rsquo;真正\u0026rsquo;改變，也就是當新的信念系統漸漸取代舊有的思維系統時，外在實相才會慢慢開始變化，而我們自己就是那唯一的見證者，講的更白話一點，就是當你用新的視野去看同一件事情時，轉變就發生了，而且這個改變是不費力的，一切發生就是自然而然的過程，並不需要意志力。』而這一切就如小哥說的一樣，這是內在的過程，我們無法從任何人身上去獲取，就如同佛陀曾說的一句話：『知識可以被分享，但智慧只能被發現。』\n這就是為什麼我的boss一直要我丟掉任何一切能提供類似指引的工具，例如:塔羅、占星等等\u0026hellip; 祂說我不需要這些東西，因為你要的答案和指引都在你的內心。雖然祂每次這樣講，但我使用塔羅占卜時，還是會透露一點點答案XD\n然後YT有一個留言引起我的注意，我覺得可以分享給大家。 內耗是一種自我審查、自我批判 自我對話是自我覺察\n我知道這世上有這樣的一群人在自我審查時，看的都是自己的缺點和改進的地方，總是拿自己跟別人來比較，我會知道是因為我有一個很消極的朋友，每次跟她相處時，我總是被她不快樂的心情感染到一點點，但我不在意，因為我有方法可以快速代謝掉這情緒，某天她突然問我：『為什麼我看待任何事情都這麼的樂觀?』當下有很多的想法在充斥我的腦袋，我想用最簡單的話語表達但我發現沒辦法，所以那時我用很簡短的話語告訴她：『可能我看了太多有關於身心靈的書籍才導致的吧！』直到今天看見這句話，我才發現事實上不是這樣的，我樂觀是因為我和她看待事情的角度不一樣，我看待自己的角度是自我成長、自我察覺，而她總是以自我批判的方式在審判自己，總是在內耗自己，總喜歡拿他人跟自己做比較，而且我也發現這些喜歡自我批判的人，其實也很常批判別人，而不是以建設性的方式看待他人和自己，事實上換個角度想，這群人就不會過著一直內耗的人生。當然我分享這些只是因為我不希望大家也跟我朋友一樣也用這樣的方式看待自己，因為過得真的很不快樂。\n","permalink":"https://ellielife.github.io/blog/2025%E5%B9%B4/2025.02.06%E5%BD%B1%E7%89%87%E6%96%87%E7%AB%A0%E5%88%86%E4%BA%AB%E5%BD%B1%E7%89%87%E5%88%86%E4%BA%AB%E5%A4%96%E5%9C%8B%E5%B0%8F%E5%93%A5%E5%93%A5%E6%95%99%E4%BD%A0%E5%A6%82%E4%BD%95%E6%B7%B1%E5%BA%A6%E8%87%AA%E6%88%91%E5%B0%8D%E8%A9%B1%E4%B8%A6%E6%89%BE%E5%88%B0%E4%BA%BA%E7%94%9F%E6%96%B9%E5%90%91/","tags":null,"title":"【影片分享】外國小哥哥教你如何深度自我對話並找到人生方向"},{"categories":["生活日記"],"contents":"P.S附上現在自己胖胖的照片\n天啊，為什麼照片那麼大張拉🙀，算了！\n2025年後這幾年，我已準備好要與這股蛻變能量一起瘋，反正無可避免的都會過得辛苦，那就痛得徹底，享受在其中，來什麼我就接受什麼！那也請承接好我反作用力的力量，誰叫我是那澆不滅吹不熄的生命之火。我可是那種越打擊我，越會奮發向上的人，不會輕易認輸，不要隨便激起我的腎上腺素\u0026hellip;，我最喜歡玩的遊戲是生存遊戲呢，呵呵！\n窮游是為了擴展自己的視野

當然不是那種馬上辭職去窮游，而是那種一次請很多假去旅遊，等我轉職成功、經濟穩定好也可以遠端工作時，我在去窮游！嘿嘿！我窮游不是為了跟風，而是想去擴展自己的視野，想去體驗不同的文化與不同的人種交流！當然有部份是因為\u0026hellip;我想移民到其他國家，想去看看哪個國家比較適合自己，哈哈哈！主要原因是個人認為台灣有點悶，覺得台灣這環境似乎有點不太適合我，除了自己的個性外，有部分原因是在台灣，對皮膚比較健康的女生來說有點不友善，總是被歧視，被差別待遇，就只是因為膚色，我真心受夠這件事情了，雖然還是有喜歡我的人在，可是很少。\n以前我對自己很沒有自信，就是因為我膚色的關係，在台灣社會的觀念裡，認為女生就是要一白遮三醜，看起來白白淨淨的才好看，在我成長的過程中，總是會遇到那些自以為對我好，實際上卻做出很傷害我的事情，例如，曾經有遇過一位阿姨看見我，就跟我說：『唉唷，你怎麼皮膚這麼黑，女孩子就是要好好保養，身體黑沒關係，但臉不能黑，要好好保養！』然後，把我拉到一旁，開始唸我皮膚要防曬，要保濕什麼什麼的，當下真的很想嗆這位阿姨，真他馬的！眼睛瞎了嗎?看不出來膚色是天生的嗎?皮膚是我能控制的嗎?我不知道正在讀這篇文章的你們能不能了解那種感受，實際上對我來說很受傷，就像我不應該生存在這樣的環境裡。\n直到有天，工作來了一位新同事，長的又高又帥，很多女同事私底下對他評價不錯！但我不以為意，因為我覺得很少人會喜歡我。 某天他突然跟我說：『自己很喜歡皮膚黑的女生，歷任女友都是皮膚黑的，只有這一任是白皮膚的，而且還是女生倒貼！追他追很久才答應的。』 我不以為意問他：『真的嗎?很少人會喜歡皮膚黑的女生。』\n他：『我是說真的！我可以給你看我歷任女友的照片，我真心覺得皮膚黑的女生不錯啊，給人感覺很陽光、大喇喇地不做作！我喜歡這樣的Style。』\n聽完當下內心有一股暖流，因為我知道這位帥同事在用自己的方式鼓勵我，言下之意就是要我對自己有自信，他應該看得出來我對自己沒自信這件事，因為我不管夏天還是冬天，都把自己包的像粽子一樣，臉上總是很厭世，沒有年經人應該要有的熱情和活潑，否則他也不會特地拿出來講自己的事，沒想到默默被意想不到的人關心，還蠻開心的。以往我都是被人家差別待遇最不好的那個人，沒想到今天也有人對我差別待遇這麼好，只要有他在的工作場合我都不無聊，會跟我打屁聊天，還會主動幫我忙，不過我們就真的只是朋友而已，沒什麼愛意之情！直到今天還是朋友喔！這段友誼已維持六年了喔，嘿嘿。\n這是第一次，有男生用自己的方式鼓勵我，他沒有選擇探究我內心深處受過什麼傷，而是以朋友聊天的方式有意無意的鼓勵我，要我找回自己，去做自己，他真心接受我原本的樣子跟我交朋友，在他的鼓舞之下，我開始慢慢去接受自己皮膚黑的事情，我不再相信那些對我不好的人，因為我知道有些人別有用意！\n這就是我開始學會愛自己的第一步，其實我還蠻感謝他的。\n與其去尋求外界的認同，不如向內探索並肯定自己的價值。 Boss給我的靈性第一課：學習愛自己。\n不要害怕與眾不同，也不要害怕去成為自己，放心地去做你自己，去學習愛自己，去學習與真實的自己對齊，你會發現自己所創造出來的能量場(人體周圍的能量場)，它所散發出來的頻率會成為你天然的屏障，天然的過濾網，它會自動幫你篩選和吸引那些對你有幫助和友好的人，至於那些不喜歡你的人就讓他們去吧！\n另外，也要學習避免外界或是環境對我們產生不好的影響，就像在生活中，老師會藉由我們的成績來衡量我們的價值，老闆會藉由我們的工作績效來衡量我們的價值，而這些衡量標準都是由外部來源所決定的，並不能真正判定你真實的價值，事實上你的內在價值是無價的，若真要有個價值衡量的話，只有你自己內心最清楚！\n唯有當你先愛自己並清楚認知到自己的內在價值時，你會明白自己根本就不需要任何人的認可和肯定，那麼外在的力量就無法對你產生影響。去學習成為自己的太陽。\n蛇年新目標

真的有些感受只有經歷過的人才知道，所以那些沒有胖過的人，不要再說不要在意這句話，畢竟台灣不像國外，懂得尊重每個人的種族、文化、膚色和體型，有機會的話我還真的蠻想在國外生活的，想體驗一下多元開放的社會，我要解放我自己 😝 不會誤會阿，各位！我這裡說的是我要穿我喜歡的衣服，畢竟這裡沒有人會批評你的身材和膚色，嘿嘿 😊。\n說真的，不知道什麼原因越來越胖了呢，明明生活作息都正常，兩年內胖20公斤，覺得身體出問題了，宇宙在提醒我要注意身體健康，所以今年的主要目標之二就是健康飲食，有沒有人要跟我一起減肥、健身的，有的話歡迎追蹤我的IG，與我聯繫，哈哈哈。(變得很開放，瘋了XD\n對了，我還有一個主要目標，就是經營塔羅頻道，頻道內容不只是塔羅占卜，還會分享有關於自我成長和身心靈療癒的知識，還有其他…魔法蠟燭、精油等等，都是我感興趣的喔

2025年的關鍵字是在破壞中重生，也就是說明年會是大家破斧成舟的一年，這股蛻變能量是加強版的，又快又猛，不趕快處理的話，可能又會有新的事件發生囉！所以我們要跟上這一波快速蛻變能量的話，我們必須要將專注力關注在自己身上，而不是在外在。\n為什麼?因為明年宇宙爸爸會藉由這股能量引領我們活出最高的生命品質，它會推動你去做一些改變來支持你活出最高善的自己，換句話說，我們都會被迫跳出舒適圈，但前提是我們要願意給老天帶領，願意面對自己生命的課題，從中學習並遵循你內心的聲音去經歷這些改變。\n但反過來，如果我們持續逃避、持續失控，死不聆聽自己的內心，不跟任何人合作、不跟老天合作、不尊重自己的感受，用盡你自己所有的能量在抗拒改變、不願意學習跟鍛鍊，那明年你就會過的很辛苦。\n同時，要有心理準備，因為這股能量也會慢慢的淘汰掉那些不再適合我們的人事物，因為它們已不能再支持我們成為更高版本的自己，已不能再支持我們活出最高善的自己，靈魂的本質是改變，所以靈魂會一直進化下去，要意識到天下沒有無不散的宴席，即使你沒有準備好，但時間到了，還是得去面對這不捨和傷心的心情，但往好的地方想，在未來的某天再遇見時，雙方的靈魂水平是平等的/相似的，又可以成為朋友或是伴侶來共同成長、共創美好的生命記憶。\n生活虐我千百遍，我待生活如初戀 祝福大家也祝福自己，在2025年給自己勇氣和自信去主動迎接挑戰和改變，不要等命運來推動，也不要等命運來審判，因為命運並不總是引導我們至正確的方向，要意識到我們是自己生命的創造者和體驗者，我們的生命故事應由我們自己撰寫，而不是宇宙為你計畫的預設版本。我們要利用這一波蛻變能量為自己爭取更多成長的機會，讓生活協助我們鍛鍊很多美好的品質。\n明年還是會有很多大大小小的社會和國際動盪，但我會希望各位將關注力放在自己身上，要學習成為颱風眼，當大家在經歷暴風雨時，你可以適時地給他們溫暖和幫助（這也是在幫助地球穩定能量喔），同時也不要害怕去經歷這些暴風雨，因為它們都是靈魂進化的好糧食，讓愛與智慧成為你的翅膀，在狂風暴雨中不費力地穿梭翱翔😂，請記住，當你覺得孤單的時候，要意識到你不是一個人在經歷這些，我們有一群夥伴正一起逆風而行，當你抵達終點站時你會看見真正的同伴。（我好像講遠了，哈哈！但沒關係！）\n送給大家一份禮物，明年做好時間規劃很重要。 其實這是我靈魂給予我的訊息，我也分享給大家吧。\n以前的我，還蠻喜歡規劃自己的每一天，會規劃年計畫、月計畫和週計畫，但後來我不再這麼做了，因為計畫總趕不上變化讓我很灰心還有我發現自己好像機器人一樣每天按錶操課，幾點幾分做什麼事，覺得好不現實，內心有股排斥感，我覺得自己不再是自己了，於是就沒有再規劃了，決定隨心所欲的過每一天。\n但幾天前，我的靈魂提醒我，明年是很重要的一年，祂希望我好好把握，祂告訴我：『基本上人類的蛻變是以5年為一個基準，5年過後再遇見相同的人時，你會發現這個人與你有著顯著上或些微的差別，不論是外貌、個人能力和社經地位等等…，那你知道為什麼同樣的24小時，有人走的快，有人走得慢嗎?那是因為這是有在做”時間規劃”的差別。』\n『現在的你正在漫無目的地前進，你確實一直在”行動”，一直在”前進”，但…沒有方向，沒有羅盤指引的船隻要怎麼往前邁進，你的目標在哪，你的中途站/終點站在哪，你就像天竺鼠一樣每天為無意義的事情或是每天的例行公事忙碌，我並不是在說這些事情不重要，而是你讓它們佔據你大多數的時間，以至於你沒有多餘的時間或是懶得抽出時間去思考未來的方向在哪，你想要完成的事情是什麼，現在正是時候去學習**「時間的運用」**，這是一項很好用的工具，你要學著將精力和時間花在重要的事情上面，認清你的方向在哪，短長期目標是什麼，而且規劃的習慣也可以幫助你省思，你會開始仔細反省自己一整天到底在忙些什麼？我希望你學會將注意力和精力放在重要的事情上面，而不是總浪費在一些瑣碎的事情上面，這只會讓自己的大腦非常地疲憊，又總覺得時間追著自己跑，而不是自己在管理時間。你應該要認清現在最重要的是：要及時做個時間記錄表，找出時間的盲點，並及時修正，重新調整步調。』\n『如果不懂的利用的話，充其量就跟我前面提到的天竺鼠一樣，以為過得很充實但實際上並沒有，你只是在原地踏步而已。**請記住，今天的你就是過去的你造成的。**如果你希望有不一樣的未來，那你就要改變，就在當下！而不是明天，明天的明天，大大後天，若是再繼續這樣下去的話，親愛的，那等著你的還是一樣的未來，那就不用對未來有什麼期待。』\n所以，這段話我也分享給大家吧，剛好明年也快要到了，也是宇宙主動推動我們的一年，那我們也要趁勢好好的搭配時間規劃，認清自己的方向和目標在哪，讓自己事半功倍，而不是漫無目的地往前邁進，找天我看看有沒有什麼很好的時間規劃書籍，我讀過覺得不錯的，在分享給大家。期許我們2025年一起成長、邁向更美好的未來。\n","permalink":"https://ellielife.github.io/blog/2024%E5%B9%B4/2024.12.25%E7%94%A8%E6%96%B0%E7%9A%84%E8%A6%96%E9%87%8E%E8%A8%B4%E8%AA%AA%E5%85%A8%E6%96%B0%E7%9A%84%E6%95%85%E4%BA%8B2025%E5%B9%B4%E5%9C%A8%E7%A0%B4%E5%A3%9E%E4%B8%AD%E9%87%8D%E7%94%9F/","tags":null,"title":"2025年，在破壞中重生。"},{"categories":["用新的視野訴說全新的故事"],"contents":"

➡️衣著光鮮亮麗，卻負債累累，生活拮据\n➡️雖然有房子和車子，卻沒有過多的資金可以存款，每個月卻是被負債追著跑。\n➡️個人負債規模還高達上百萬人民幣。\n這不經讓我思考，在過去大多數人對成功的定義，認為有房有車白領的工作是成功人士的重要指標，但隨著科技不斷的發展，過去我們認為的這些成功和幸福指標在未來反而不是年輕人重要的首選，甚至不再成為年輕人對於成功的典範。現在成功的典範對每個人來說都不同，因為每個人所選擇的生活方式不一樣。\n比如我，比起世俗的成功，我比較在意自己是否活的幸福、開心和快樂，即使我沒有擁有很多錢，但至少我活得很自由，我不再為了金錢長時間待在公司或工廠，而是花更多的時間與自己、朋友或是親愛的人相處，花更多的時間去體驗這個世界，金錢對我來說不再是幸福的重要指標，因為年老時，我可以回到自己的家鄉種種菜，養一些小動物之類的，實現自給自足的生活。(如果可以的話，我想養馬，騎著牠在鄉野間奔馳一定很帥！我甚至想帶牠環島，哈哈哈。)\n在我小的時候，我的奶奶和舅舅就是這樣生活的，吃自己種的菜，養豬養雞養鵝養狗狗，甚至還有養牛和擁有兩座小魚池塘，我舅舅是建築工人，所以他會diy自己的房子，然後會拿一些東西與附近鄰居交換所需的物品，基本上大家都很願意交換的，完全不需要用到金錢，而且有時候鄰居也會分享好吃的食物給我們，我們也會，小時候我就明白自己很喜歡這樣的生活，很快樂也很愜意，我就很喜歡奶奶家戶外的大客廳，這裡是家人和附近鄰居感情交流的地方，等於是我們的交誼廳就對了，我也很喜歡奶奶總是在天氣好的時候，拿出一張躺椅，在樹蔭下曬太陽和乘涼，真的很Chill！長大後，我就知道自己的退休生活是長什麼樣的，因為我的奶奶和舅舅為我示範了很好的典範。(順便偷偷告訴你們，不要看我奶奶和舅舅過這樣的生活，其實他們很有錢，有不少的積蓄，但他們還是選擇過這樣簡單樸實的生活，這是他們去世以後我才知道的事情。)\n與其買車買房，被綑綁30-50年之間，不如做資產分配，過有品質的生活 是我的話，我寧願租房子，原因之一是我不太喜歡城市高樓大廈一層又一層的房子，我是鄉下長大的孩子，喜歡透天厝、喜歡庭園、喜歡大自然，所以與其被綑綁30-50年之間，不如過有體面的生活，扣掉年老退休生活基金，我還可以買喜歡的衣服，剪喜歡的頭髮造型，買喜歡的保養品和化妝品，重點是我要吃好一點，畢竟我這一生好珍貴喔！對靈魂而言，每一世的體驗都很珍貴，所以你這一生也很珍貴，要好好珍惜！愛自己的同時不要忘了也要愛身邊的人，與他們創造美好的生命記憶，畢竟這一世過後你不知道在未來還會不會遇到相同的靈魂跟你一起體驗人生呢！\n擁抱不確定，自由職業是未來趨勢 隨著通貨膨脹、物價不斷的上漲，我們每位勞動者承擔的債務在不斷的增加，而且債務增長速度超過了收入的增長。我們不得不工作更長的時間來還債，可支配的時間變少。你們能想像現在每一位剛出生的嬰兒，就已經背負好幾代的債務嗎?根據IMF全球政府負債比的報告，日本政府負債佔GDP的比重為245%，美國政府171%，中國佔111%，而台灣真是跌破我的眼鏡竟然只佔GDP22.5%，而且預測會逐年下降，真的好低，不得不誇一下，台灣好棒棒喔！要好好維持喔，親愛的同胞！。\n※資料來源 財經M平方\n好，台灣是個例外情況，我的意思是說，在全球政府負債佔正每一年增加，在這種情況下，與其跟人一起出去花錢吃喝玩樂，倒不如直接消費互聯網內容，而且在未來人們更願意為互聯網上優質的內容付費更高的價格，畢竟優質的內容現在可是很稀缺的呢！\n如果要跳脫這個迴圈，就要擁抱不確定，發展和經營個人品牌，自由職業是未來的趨勢。\n個人自媒體時代的崛起 很多人都認為人人自媒體的時代已經結束，但我個人卻認為現在反而是自媒體崛起的剛開始，在未來，你會看到有越來越多的人會聽從自己內在的聲音去發展個人品牌，否則的話，很難在未來獲得競爭力。而且好工作都是透過介紹來的，不是自己去尋找，所以如果要跳脫這時代經濟不確定性帶來的負面效應，那你就要\u0026quot;趁現在”把握機會去發展自媒體，讓更多的人去認識你，知道你的興趣和愛好，知道你的專業，如果你想要讓大家願意為你的服務支付更高的價格，那你就需要挪有別人不具備的IP，在未來是人人自媒體的時代，會有越來越多的人透過網路去認識你，人們喜歡聽活生生的故事，可以與之互動鮮活的人，這就是為什麼許多大明星在網路直播賣東西時，都要親自跳下來的原因。\n那…我們不一定要成為大明星或者是大網紅，我們只要在自己感興趣和熱愛的領域內深耕發展就好，為自己培養一群忠實的粉絲客戶，反正只要大家有相關業務需求時，至少你是在名單內的，甚至是別人第一優先考量，這樣就好，至少你不會餓死，哈哈哈。\n","permalink":"https://ellielife.github.io/blog/2024%E5%B9%B4/2024.12.15%E7%94%A8%E6%96%B0%E7%9A%84%E8%A6%96%E9%87%8E%E8%A8%B4%E8%AA%AA%E5%85%A8%E6%96%B0%E7%9A%84%E6%95%85%E4%BA%8B%E6%93%81%E6%8A%B1%E4%B8%8D%E7%A2%BA%E5%AE%9A%E8%87%AA%E7%94%B1%E8%81%B7%E6%A5%AD%E6%98%AF%E6%9C%AA%E4%BE%86%E7%9A%84%E8%B6%A8%E5%8B%A2/","tags":null,"title":"擁抱不確定，自由職業是未來的趨勢"},{"categories":["生活日記"],"contents":"前幾天，我在FB加入了某靈性社團，想說有一陣子沒加入靈性圈了，想進去了解看看最近的靈性圈子在流行什麼，結果馬上就有人密我說：『請問你是星際種子嗎?』\n我看到…笑了一下，內心OS:”難不成要加入你們的社團，還要有特殊身分?”\n但我還是禮貌的回覆：『我不知道自己是不是，但我從小就喜歡探索身心靈相關領域。』\n然後，他傳了有關於辨別自己是不是星際種子的文章給我看，問我說：『有感覺嗎?』\n其實這篇文章我早在10年前就看過了，我很清楚這篇文章是怎麼\u0026quot;定義”和”教你辨認”自己是不是星際種子，

真正的光之工作者/星際種子/流浪者或是來自其他高維度的靈魂，真的一點都不在乎這些代名詞，因為對他們來說，他們就只是在做自己熱愛做的事，這既是他們的天賦和興趣又能夠幫助別人和成就自己，誰不想做呢? 且對他們來說，眾生平等，沒有上下階級之分，祂們投身地球一樣也是有自身要學習的課題，一樣要透過自我認識才能發現自己的天賦和興趣，不會因為靈魂比較高等就有特殊優待，相反，反而會承擔比較多的家族和地球業力，這點是真的，畢竟還是要幫助地球和低維度的靈魂進化，但在他們眼裡真的一視同仁，所以… 當有人跟你說他是光之工作者或是其他代名詞時，不管他說的是不是真的，你只要看他平常的所作所為就知道他是不是了，因為真正的光之工作者/星際種子/流浪者/其他高維度靈魂，在幫助地球和人類時都很低調，甚至不願意讓大家知道他們是誰，因為這只不過是一件在平凡不過的事情。\n","permalink":"https://ellielife.github.io/blog/2024.12.10%E7%94%9F%E6%B4%BB%E6%97%A5%E8%A8%98%E7%9C%9F%E6%AD%A3%E7%9A%84%E5%85%89%E4%B9%8B%E5%B7%A5%E4%BD%9C%E8%80%85/%E6%98%9F%E9%9A%9B%E7%A8%AE%E5%AD%90/%E6%B5%81%E6%B5%AA%E8%80%85%E6%98%AF%E4%B8%8D%E6%9C%83%E6%9C%89%E4%BB%A3%E5%90%8D%E8%A9%9E%E7%9A%84%E4%BB%96%E5%80%91%E5%8F%AA%E8%83%BD%E6%98%AF%E6%98%AF%E4%BB%96%E5%80%91%E6%89%80%E6%98%AF/","tags":null,"title":"真正的光之工作者/星際種子/流浪者，是不會有代名詞的，他們只能”是”他們所是。"},{"categories":["用新的視野訴說全新的故事"],"contents":" 圖片取自思維致富\n最近每次在新聞上看見美國總統川普，就會讓我想起一本書叫做：被討厭的勇氣。\n我覺得這本書所表達的概念，川普把它發揮的淋漓盡致，他絲毫不在乎其他人怎麼批評，他只想做他想做的事。\n這本書主要是闡述阿德勒的個體心理學，他的核心思想是並不是要你做令人討厭的事，而是要你有直視世界，做自己的勇氣。 而巴夏的信仰體系也跟阿德勒的思想是一樣的，他曾經也說過:『當你為自己而活的時候，整個世界都會圍繞著你運轉！』\n實際上，在這方面，我心目中有倆個人選真得做的很好，那就是美國總統川普跟馬斯克這兩個人，因為他們活出這本書想要傳達給世人的概念─\u0026ldquo;活出自己、活出自由\u0026rdquo;，他們是真正活出自己的人。\n要活出自己、活出自由意味著你就是那個不合群的人，而我相信我們每個人都不想要被討厭，因為被討厭就等於被孤立，被排擠，甚至別人會視你為異端分子，把你孤立在圈子之外，而我們人類是群居的動物，在我們的內心裡總有那麼一部分是渴望得到別人的認可，因此我們為了要符合社會對我們的期待和認可，我們不知不覺按照社會給我們的規範和楷模要我們活出社會教育下想要的乖孩子和合群化的我們。\n合群化就意味著我們要捨棄一部分的自己，但如果過度的追隨群體，往往會導致個體平庸的我們!然而，我們也必須要意識到的是合群化，其實它並不關心某一個人的幸福和未來的自身發展，它唯一在意的是維持自身的運轉。很多人都認為不合群的人是極度自我中心的人，但實際上往往卻是尊重多樣性的人，因為他們既不強行融入也不強行干涉，或是要求他人一定要喜歡自己，用現在的話來說就是很有邊界感，但他們反而很開放和寬容，你可以去觀察看看身邊有沒有這樣不合群的人，他們一定都是很尊重個體的多樣性的，或者你自己就是那個人，你是不是就跟我說的一樣呢?\n當然，不合群不代表要脫離社會，我們只是需要一套能夠正確指導我們的方法論，讓我們的獨特性發揮出積極的作用，僅此而已。因此做為一個不合群或者想要讓自己擁有獨立性的人，我們就應該要找方法來讓我們在合群和獨立性之間找到平衡，即如何在不合群的同時，實現自我目標。另外，如果你有在觀察整個世界的話，你會發現地球金字塔的頂端大部分都是由一群不合群的人在領導著，他們是真正建立規則的人，而我們合群的人反而成為他們的追隨者。\n而某方面來說川普和馬斯克正是那個不合群的人，儘管這世界有一部份的人不喜歡他們，但不可否認的是這個世界正是因為有伊隆.馬斯克的存在，人類科技才有進步的可能性，正是因為有唐納·川普這樣大刀闊斧的存在，美國和整個世界才會有新的可能性，許多人不明白川普為了他心目中的理想，不惜一切代價，與許多產業大佬們或是各個國家為敵廝殺，甚至賭上自己的性命，因為擋到太多人的財路，但他不在乎，他只在乎───自己是否正在做對他來說正確的事，儘管現在還看不出什麼，但我相信50年後100年後，當我們的後代子孫回顧這一段歷史的時候，會與我們有不一樣的視野和看法。\n許多人不理解他們是正常的，因為我們沒有與他們站在同樣的高度和視野去看整個局面，如果你有機會與他們站在同樣的視角，我相信你會有不一樣的看法和見解。當然人都不是完美的存在，如果有人的某些特質特別優秀，那麼就會有某些特質是不那麼令人欣賞的。這就像我們女人選男人是一樣的，如果我們要一個事業有成、可以賺很多錢的另一伴，那我們就必須明白，在我們想要他們陪伴的時候，他是無法抽身陪伴的，甚至有時候會有毀約的狀況發生，如果我們要的是擁有很多時間陪伴我們的另一伴，那我們就必須明白，我們的另一伴可能就不會賺很多錢，如果我們要的是有錢又有時間陪伴我們的另一伴(通常是富二代、事業有成的男人)，就必須要明白通常這樣的男人在外面可能還會有其他女人的機率存在，再如果真的遇到有錢有時間又忠心的男人，那我們就必須要明白這男人身上可能存在某些性格缺陷，這取決於我們想要過什麼樣的生活，這世上沒有男人是完美的存在，而我們女人同樣也是，一定都會有些缺陷，就看我們能不能接受而已。\n這同樣也套用在世界上每個優秀的人身上，一切就看你們怎麼想囉。\n以塔羅師的角度來看，如果我說川普正是被『命運』選中的，你們相信嗎?哈哈。 塔羅牌裡面有一張命運的牌卡，這張牌對我而言，是一張機會與命運的牌卡，有玩過桌上遊戲大富翁的人，應該會知道這張牌代表的是什麼，很多時候我們人生總是會有那麼一些時刻是幸運的或是很衰的，再加上，冥王星在11月20日正式進入為期20年水水瓶座時代，從西洋占星的角度來看，冥王水平會為這個社會帶來巨大的改變和變革，回顧上次冥王星進入水瓶座是幾百年前的事情，在當時人類進入了啟蒙時代，這是一個哲學思想和科學發明上百花齊放的時代，比如《牛頓》的萬有引力，《笛卡爾》的我思故我在以及《伽利略》的地球繞太陽公轉的學說，都是那個時代的產物，因此我們很幸運即將見證人類下一波的啟蒙時代。要有心理準備在未來會有很多東西即將被顛覆和被改變，像是在未來很多過去我們習以為常的觀念也正在被改變當中，比如結婚生子，不再是被認為人生圓滿所必備的過程，許多人甚至主動地去選擇不婚不生，他們的生活一樣過個很美好和精彩，我大膽猜測，在未來10-20年，婚姻制度的相關法規會發生變化，再舉例，比如說讀書求學，現在高學歷不再是高工資的保證，在這個失業率居高不下的環境裡，人們開始會反思高學歷的必要性。\n好啦，扯遠了，關於冥王水瓶時代會帶來那些轉變的相關資料可以上網查喔(抱歉，作者很懶，要講的話真的會需要有幾篇的篇幅呢，哈哈)。\n我主要是想表述唐納·川普正是被冥王星選中的時代先鋒者，為什麼這麼說呢?因為唐納·川普的塔羅命數是4/0，0號在塔羅牌裡代表的是愚人牌，而愚人牌的代表星就是冥王星，而4號在塔羅牌裡是皇帝牌，在歷代很多國家的總統，尤其是剛好正逢戰亂、競爭很強的時代，都很容易誕生出3號皇后牌或是4號皇帝的總統，而川普就是4號皇帝，在加上今年川普的塔羅流年剛好就是命運牌，而明年也就是川普上任的那一年就是正義牌，正義牌就是一張一定會當選的牌卡。但為什麼今年塔羅流年是10號命運牌的川普會當選，這個等一下會揭曉。\n而賀錦麗的塔羅命數是5/1，也就是魔術師和教宗牌，而魔術師在地球歷代總統裡是沒有這個塔羅人格上任的，而賀錦麗的1號魔術師對上川普的4號皇帝牌，首先第一輪的競爭就輸了，但有趣的是剛好今年賀錦麗的塔羅流年是正義牌，對上川普的命運牌就比較佔優勢，我前面有說過正義牌的話就是一定會當選的牌，所以原本應該會當選的賀錦麗為什麼最後是川普當選，原因就是因為川普有四個地方加持。\n4號皇帝人格 (剛好現在是戰亂、競爭激烈的時代，甚至在未來有可能會爆發第三次世界大戰，所以一定會誕生出一位主帥總統坐鎮。) 洽逢冥王星進入水瓶時期，搭配他的愚人牌，也就代表即使前方有危險，川普還是會毅然決然地往前邁進，剛好這個世界就需要像川普這樣的愚人性格，才能創造出新的火花。) 被命運選中 (因為川普的愚人性質，所以被命運選中) 剛好他的上任年就是正義牌 題外話，台灣近幾年也是會很不平衡，地震可能會很頻繁且對岸有可能會想發動第三次世界大戰，其實第三次世界大戰的戰場很可能是在亞洲，所以\u0026hellip;可以趁現在去物色那些國家比較安全，就去避難吧。我個人認為澳洲不錯喔😊 但我還是要說:\u0026ldquo;天佑台灣\u0026rdquo;\n但賀錦麗有個5號教宗牌，這是比較適合當社會運動的改革者，但你要他當總統是不太適合的。所以如果時空背景是她是社會運動的改革者要推翻當權政府的話，這是真的很有可能的喔，但現在的時空背景就不是這樣，所以川普會當選是1000%會上任的，同時，川普上任也可以很好的反應一個國家的狀態，為什麼美國人民比起民主黨更傾向投票給這個不穩定因素很多的川普?我覺得這是一個很值得深思的問題，但我不想討論這個。\n然而，即使抽到命運這張牌卡，也不一定意味著改變的過程是一帆風順的，是有天命加持的，反之還會是痛苦的，但這張命運牌確實是將人類帶往好的方向發展，但反觀我們人類卻活得很痛苦，為什麼會這樣呢?因為我們人類正在朝向更文明更進步的方向發展，有很多舊有的、不合時宜的觀念已不再適合未來的新時代了，時代在前進，當然我們的思維和觀念也會跟著改變和變化，試想看看，以前的農耕社會思想能套用在現今的社會發展嗎?當然是不行啊，所以現在正是人類內在和外在巨大清理和清洗的過程，在未來還會有更大的變動發生，但相反地我們人類卻會因為這些痛苦的經歷而更加地去思索我們的社會到底怎麼了，這真是我們想要的嗎?為什麼現今科技這麼發達還一堆人過得不快樂等等\u0026hellip;一系列的深度思考，從而誘發我們從個體到全體的改變，所以川普帶來的不穩定和變動性是必要的。當然，我們這些小螺絲釘也很重要喔，我們都是不可或缺的存在。\n請把握機會發展自己的品牌，活出自己想要的未來，活出自由！ 前面有說過，自今年11月20日冥王星已正式進入水瓶座，人類已正式進入個人的自媒體時代，在未來不再是大公司的獨角戲，反而是小公司或是個體戶的小眾時代，因此只要你有好好的發展個人品牌，那麼你就會有一小部分的人是支持你和喜歡你的，要明白我們每個人都是獨一而二的存在，我們每個人都可以是網紅或是意見領袖，之所以特別拿川普和馬斯克舉例就是要你們明白，你們也可以像他們一樣活出自己，讓整個世界圍繞著你們運轉。當然，要你們活出自己、活出自由不是要你們活的自私，而是你可以根據情況決定，如果你想活出自己、活出自由，那你可以嘗試以下方法:\n你可以列一個清單，想想看有哪些是能帶夠給他人價值，雖然得不到他人的讚揚或是認可，但你仍然會熱愛去做的事情，嘗試不帶功利心地去做這件事情。 當他人不喜歡自己的時候，你能不能放下那種想要改變他人看法的衝動。 你是否擁有足夠的好奇心和自驅力始一如終的去做這件事。 如果有，那就恭喜你，為自己取得一張入門門票，在未來你的事業會發展多大，就看你有沒有那個意志力去做下去了。\n","permalink":"https://ellielife.github.io/blog/2024%E5%B9%B4/2024.11.30%E7%94%A8%E6%96%B0%E7%9A%84%E8%A6%96%E9%87%8E%E8%A8%B4%E8%AA%AA%E5%85%A8%E6%96%B0%E7%9A%84%E6%95%85%E4%BA%8B%E8%A2%AB%E8%A8%8E%E5%8E%AD%E7%9A%84%E5%8B%87%E6%B0%A3/","tags":null,"title":"不合群?想自由?你是否擁有被討厭的勇氣?"},{"categories":["靈性文章和影片分享"],"contents":"

以下要推薦的影片是來自巴夏的訊息，這影片的訊息含金量很高，看得懂就看得懂，看不懂沒關係，等時間到了你在看一次又會有不同的見解，總之巴夏是說現在是地球轉換期的時刻，你的靈魂選擇此時來到這裡其實也是想透過自己的一份力量幫助地球，因地球是宇宙中極少數黑暗的星球，對於全體宇宙種族來說，要在極限中將黑暗轉換成光明不容易，會需要經歷一段黑暗期，我們會在極限中創造一條屬於人類光明的道路，地球其實是被另一個不懷好意的勢力影響很久了，但沒關係，它們可以持續製造混亂，但它們阻止不了來自更高緯度意識決心要讓地球和其上的所有物種進化，地球是一顆美麗的行星，祂是時候恢復祂神聖的光芒和宇宙中的位置。\n地外智慧生命─── 愛莎莎妮星球人 巴夏是來自愛莎莎妮星球的第五維度的外星人，根據巴夏所說是在獵戶座裡，愛莎莎妮星球人是我們人類與灰人的後代子孫，巴夏說了一句我覺得很受用，過去-現在-未來 同時存在，換言之，現在的星球轉換期，不只其他宇宙種族也有混血人類的後代子孫在看，就連來自未來的人類也在同時觀看，但我相信他們也在以另一種方式幫助地球，就像巴夏是以提供訊息的方式提醒我們，但更多是需要此時此刻生活在地球上的人幫助，這一個工作不容易，希望我們一起加油！\n為什麼推薦他呢?是因為在眾多靈媒管道裡，就我接觸的 ─ 巴夏是我認為最值得信任的，若你們想了解他的話可以上網搜尋。\n為什麼相信? 因我的祖母是個靈媒，她跟巴夏的傳訊人一樣是可以傳達來自另一世界的訊息也可以看到來自另一維度的靈性世界，再加上自己本身也是個敏感體質，也有通靈的經驗，所以我從小就明白這世界遠比我們想像的更加豐富，不管你們相不相信，人類遲早會面臨接受地外智慧生命的存在，如果你抗拒的話，我是建議早點敞開心扉接受新事物的存在，因為再過不了幾年，地外智慧生命的存在將會被揭露，政府要隱瞞也隱瞞不了多久了，地外智慧生命將會與我們人類作接觸，當他們認為時機到了就會出現。\n巴夏訊息

這是我最喜歡的影片，現在我們正在經歷的是黎明前黑暗的開始，同時也是個人靈魂進化的時刻，雖然影片所描述的是很久以後的未來，但沒關係，這本來就需要好幾代人的努力，而現階段我們之中有一部分人的工作是需要專注在內在的靈性功課，因為這是我們靈魂的畢業考，假設我們內在靈性功課做得很成功，會反映在後代人類DNA裡，這也算是對人類物種進化一項很重要的幫助。\n","permalink":"https://ellielife.github.io/blog/2024%E5%B9%B4/2024.11.24%E9%9D%88%E6%80%A7%E6%96%87%E7%AB%A0%E5%92%8C%E5%BD%B1%E7%89%87%E5%88%86%E4%BA%AB%E5%BD%B1%E7%89%87%E5%88%86%E4%BA%AB%E4%BD%A0%E9%81%B8%E6%93%87%E4%BE%86%E5%88%B0%E5%9C%B0%E7%90%83-%E8%BD%89%E5%8C%96%E8%88%87%E6%95%B4%E5%90%88%E9%BB%91%E6%9A%97/","tags":null,"title":"【影片分享】你選擇來到地球

對我而言，如果沒有發生這三件事，我就不會認定他是怪人，但不幸地是它確實發生了，所以我只能用\u0026quot;怪人\u0026quot;來稱呼我的新同事，有很多關於他的行為我不是很能理解就是了。(若有讀者理解的話，歡迎留言告知😊，謝謝。)\n第一件事───他無法主動告知有找到便當這件事 中午與他一起訂公司便當，我們約好一起去公司櫃台小姐拿，抵達後我拿好自己的，換他\u0026hellip;\n他與櫃台小姐說:『我忘了我訂什麼便當，你可以幫我看一下嗎?』\n櫃台小姐:『你叫什麼名字?』\n他說出自己的名字後，櫃台小姐:『你是訂XX便當。』\n他:『對麻，我記得自己是訂XX便當。』\n然後，他在桌上翻找自己的便當:『奇怪，我怎麼沒有看到我的?』\n櫃台小姐:『真的嗎?如果沒有的話，那就可能有人拿錯了?』\n他又翻找確認一下說:『對阿，沒有\u0026hellip;\u0026hellip;.』\n(此時，根本就沒有人發現他說的話沒有說完，包括我，因為沒有那句話聽起來根本就是肯定句。)\n櫃台小姐聽到後很緊張:『真的沒有嗎?』\n然後，她站起身來一邊確認桌上已分類好的便當數量，一邊與電腦上的訂購單和已領取的數量做確認。就連櫃台小姐的主管也主動加入幫忙確認，如果真的有人拿錯的話，代表有一個便當是多出來的。大概過了10分鐘左右，櫃台小姐已確認好表示:『可是，我這邊確認到沒有人拿錯便當耶，數量都對得上。』他：『對阿，我剛就是要跟你說\u0026hellip;沒有問題，有找到我的便當在這個袋子上。』\n此時，我聽到後真的很想翻他白眼，心中OS:\u0026ldquo;為什麼剛剛不趕快說，非得要等人家確認好才說。\u0026rdquo;\n(我有點火大，但因為是第一次且這種情況不常見，所以我還可以接受，我相信那位櫃台小姐和他的主管想法應該跟我是一樣的，陪他耗了10分鐘左右。)\n第二件事───他無法主動告知別人明天請假這件事 這個怪人禮拜五有事已請好假，剛好樓下主管要他幫忙的事情也弄好了，於是站起身來請示部門主管後就下樓了，差不多過半小時左右回來，主管看他又拿一堆東西回來:『怎麼東西這麼多，你有跟他告知你明天有事請假嗎?』怪人:『因為他一直講話，我插不上話。』\n我聽得出來，主管不是很滿意這個答案，已有點情緒，不過還是默默拿起電話通知樓下的主管他明天請假的事情。掛完電話後，主管:『下次記得一定要主動告知，不然人家交代你一堆事情，結果明天沒人處理。』那個怪人聽到後沒有說話。\n好的，類似的情況又再度發生，我是不知道他到底是怎麼了，我只知道我真的很不能理解這件事😱，主動告知人家明天有事請假很難嗎?主動告知有找到便當很難嗎?我真的很不能理解。\n第三件事───他無法主動告知自己有帶筷子這件事。 在這件事發生以前，我真的很不能理解他無法主動帶筷子這件事，因為訂公司便當不會附上筷子，所以會需要自己帶。我其實有自己的餐具，但因為這個怪人無法主動帶筷子的原因，我默默同他一起使用免洗筷。\n直到有天我跟他說:『抱歉，我今天出門很忙所以沒有準備，剛好我的背包有一個是上次去全家買午餐時拿的\u0026hellip;』 我還沒有說完，他就打斷我說:『沒關係，那我就拿自己的筷子！』\n好的，聽到當下我真的有點生氣，但我還是忍下來了，因為我覺得\u0026hellip;既然你有帶筷子，那幹嘛不主動跟我說，然後這段時間以來都是我在提供，我真的有點火大，但沒關係，我已經決定好下次只帶自己的餐具就好，不再用免洗筷，我本來就沒有要用的說，而且因為沒有帶筷子而無法吃到食物，那是你的事情你的責任，更何況這是你早已知道的事情，那不是我的職責，我也不是你媽你姐，謝謝。(本該如此！)\n針對自己的行為反省 事後想想，其實自己會有這樣子的行為是因為我真的有遇到對我很好的前同事(現在已成為朋友)，會處處為我著想，而且那時候我是新進來的。\n有天，我問前同事：『幹嘛對我那麼好?我有點承受不起！』\n她：『怎麼，你有壓力啦?若是這樣的話，那我會收斂自己對你的行為，因為我覺得大家都是上班的同事，都要在一起相處這麼長時間，有事大家就一起互相幫忙、互相照顧一下嘛！如果你真的有壓力要跟我說哦，這樣我就會知道了！』\n若沒有帶筷子這件事情套用在我那位前同事的話，她一定會跟我說：『沒關係，我家裡有很多筷子呢！你需要的話，我明天就帶一整包給你。』 噗，想到她那張傻臉搭配這句傻話就想笑，是她的話真的一定會這樣跟我說，但問題是那個人是我，有自知之明！而不是這個怪人。\n不過沒關係，做錯事改就好了，下次這個怪人再沒帶筷子，我就會明確告知他說:『不好意思，我沒帶耶！我現在都是使用鐵製的餐具😊。』 (唉阿\u0026hellip;不好意思，吃不到便當是你家的事情，請自己買想辦法，好吧，小弟弟，是時候你該長大了！因為你的行為確實也造成我的困擾。)\n","permalink":"https://ellielife.github.io/blog/2024%E5%B9%B4/2024.11.23%E7%94%9F%E6%B4%BB%E6%97%A5%E8%A8%98%E8%A6%AA%E6%84%9B%E7%9A%84%E4%B8%8A%E5%B8%9D%E8%AB%8B%E6%B4%BE%E6%A8%82%E8%A7%80%E7%A9%8D%E6%A5%B5%E4%B8%BB%E7%BE%A9%E8%80%85%E5%9C%A8%E6%88%91%E8%BA%AB%E9%82%8A%E5%A5%BD%E5%97%8E/","tags":[""],"title":"親愛的上帝，請派樂觀積極主義者在我身邊，好嗎?"},{"categories":["程式語言"],"contents":"

我知道很多人都很反對川普，也知道川普當選會帶來很多的不確定性，但不知道為什麼我的靈魂交給我的資訊都是比較偏向川普好的一面，或許在更高的意識層級上，真的只有川普能為世界帶來更大的變革，而且這個變革是往好的方向發展，即使\u0026quot;看起來\u0026quot;是在往壞的方向發展，不管如何，我信任我的靈魂。\n為什麼我信任我的靈魂?因為有關於我的一切，都是自身靈魂給我的教導，若沒有祂的引導，我可能跟一同跟我長大的兄弟姊妹一個樣。而且我也知道有時我的靈感來自靈魂的提示，就像這篇文章一樣2024年，與過去的自己說再見。\n其實發這篇文章的時候，我並不知道2024年會是眾多國家總統大選的一年。\n所以經過文章的紀錄，我可以知道自己的靈感蠻準確的，所以我信任我的靈感和靈魂。\n還記得，小時候不知道累積多少痛苦的感受，難過到有自殺的念頭時，某天晚上睡覺時有個陌生女子出現在我的夢中，沒有說話帶著一抹微笑，看見祂有如充電一般給我滿滿的溫暖，祂蹲下身子捧著我的雙手並微笑說：『親愛的，不要難過，其實你比想像中的還要勇敢，還要堅韌，不要放棄，我和你還有任務沒有完成(我是不知道什麼啦)呢，不過你放心，有我在身邊你不有事的，你很幸運能看見自身靈魂真正的模樣，若你用心感受應該就能明白了吧。』這是我第一次看見祂的靈魂形象，祂擁有一頭很漂亮且熱情的紅棕色長髮和一雙很搭配祂頭髮的紅棕色眼睛，還是少女的模樣，目測大概是17或是18歲的樣子，這是我意想不到的驚喜，從沒想過自己的靈魂形象居然是這樣，重點還是這頭紅棕色頭髮，真的是千千萬萬想不到(突然想起大學有一年，聽從髮型師的建議也把自己染成那時很流行的紅棕色頭髮，大家評價普遍說好看！)此時默默在心裏OS：性格和形象跟人類的我也差太多了吧，哀，我認輸了，現在我能感受到就算不用握住手，隔著距離，也能感受到祂那熱情又火熱的飽滿能量，但祂的能量卻不像火焰般四處亂串，反而像山一樣，穩穩地安住在祂的內心，是個很安定的內在力量，就像一顆小太陽一樣，照亮自己也照亮別人，這就是我的靈魂之光，然後，祂自稱自己是小獅子，哈哈哈，聽到當下真的是笑死我了XD。\n(好像是真的，從小我的好朋友就是獅子座的，常帶著我冒險做傻事、做事也大膽、很有自己的風格，不過讓我意外地是她能接受別人對她負面的批評，同時也會自我反省和改進，跟我相比，我比較低調，不喜歡引人注目，小時候多虧她的福，我也成為焦點人物的一員，我和好朋友簡直就是冰與火的結合，那時看星座書籍上說金牛跟獅子很不合，但我跟我的獅子好友卻意外很合，或許這可以解釋為什麼我能接受跟我個性很不一樣的原因吧，因為在我的內心裡住著一位小獅子，但若真的要比較的話，我的好朋友比較像是幼稚版的獅子，而我的靈魂是經過淬鍊版的。)\n我現在明白祂所說的，其實你比想像中的還要勇敢這句話，因為一旦是祂決定要去做的事情，祂會毫無畏懼前進，因為祂明白所有的經歷，不管好的還是壞的，都是一種收穫，在祂的眼裡沒有失敗這個詞，失敗是人類賦予的詞，實際上並沒有失敗，有的只有中場休息和放棄，而中場休息是暫時的，放棄才是真的失敗，只要你不放棄，成功是必然的，就像祂接受挑戰來到地球洗禮一樣，地球在祂的眼中是一顆很美麗的行星，不只如此地球也是祂自身靈魂進化最重要的一環，而現在正是時候，我講這句話時，我感受到一股能量在我內心發熱。\n好啦，廢話不多說，以上我所說的話，一樣請擷取與自己內心共鳴的部分，信就信，不信就不信，我主要是想表達：我相信且信任我的靈魂教給我的資訊，並同祂信任川普一樣，會為世界帶來好的轉變。\n至於川普會為我們來什麼轉變呢?\n老實說，我也不知道耶，哈哈。\n讓我們拭目以待吧，同時也見證我的直覺和這份來自靈魂的信任感是否是對的。\n","permalink":"https://ellielife.github.io/blog/2024%E5%B9%B4/2024.11.13%E7%94%9F%E6%B4%BB%E6%97%A5%E8%A8%98%E4%BB%A3%E8%A1%A8%E6%84%9A%E4%BA%BA%E7%9A%84%E5%B7%9D%E6%99%AE%E6%88%91%E5%90%8C%E9%9D%88%E9%AD%82%E4%BF%A1%E4%BB%BB%E4%BD%A0%E6%9C%83%E7%82%BA%E9%80%99%E4%B8%96%E7%95%8C%E5%B8%B6%E4%BE%86%E5%A5%BD%E8%BD%89%E8%AE%8A/","tags":[""],"title":"代表愚人的川普，我同靈魂信任你會為這世界帶來好的轉變。"},{"categories":["生活日記"],"contents":"分享自《中央社》(懶得修圖，哈哈。)\n中國有諺語：\u0026ldquo;不管白貓黑貓，只要會抓老鼠就是好貓。\u0026rdquo;\n這句話可以很好的套用在這次的美國總統大選，\n老實說川普和賀錦麗都不是很好的總統人選，\n但只要能解決大部份選民所關注的議題就是好總統。\n選民才不管川普在過去所犯下的罪名有多少，\n才不管拜登的\u0026quot;垃圾論\u0026quot;，才不管賀錦麗的\u0026quot;奇怪\u0026quot;稱號，\n反正不管你們是誰只要能解決我們所關注的問題就好，\n這才是大部分選民的心聲好嗎?\n\u0026ldquo;不要把大部分的民眾當白痴\u0026rdquo;，\n還是有眼睛看，有耳多聽的民眾在，\n這個結果就是美國集體意識所決定的，

幾年前，我在三重租了一間套房，這套房租金便宜，空間也很大，總體而言我還蠻滿意的。還記得，剛租下房子的前幾個禮拜某幾個夜晚，沒有固定的時間，發生時間總是在夜晚，在我熟睡的時候。\n在這裡，先跟大家說一件事，那就是其實我的身體還蠻敏感的，感知力可能比一般人高一點點，若我有聽話保養好身體的話，身體狀況極佳下可以感知到大環境能量的變化，甚至是預知一點點的未來，我會知道也是因為透過認識自己的過程中體悟到的，而這次也是這樣，只要有任何靈體靠近(你們認知上的妖魔鬼怪)，若是發生在我熟睡時，我總是不明原因\u0026quot;起床\u0026quot;，我不知道為什麼\u0026hellip;但我覺得這是我的靈魂或是守護靈保護我的一種方式，上次我也是這樣幫我前男友驅走附著在他身上的靈，一個跟著我們回家的靈，因我看不到，所以具體是什麼類型的，我不知道，這故事下次分享。\n好，總之這次也是這樣，我\u0026hellip;又在半夜裡醒來，上次發生這樣的狀況差不多是兩年前，醒來後，房間黑漆漆的，我坐在床上靜靜的聆聽著，表面上我很冷靜沒有懼怕的模樣，但實際內心蠻害怕的，畢竟我看不到，誰知道是不是長得很可怕，不過也還好我看不到，所以還留有一點點的勇氣，此時我聽到房間內東西移動的聲音、腳步聲等等，甚至是\u0026hellip;聽到疑似人類的聲音在講話(似乎是個女的)，這裡給大家科普一下，沒遇過的人應該都不知道，其實\u0026hellip;鬼魂也是會製造聲音的，只不過祂們需要花費更多周圍的能量來凝聚出聲，這種會使用周圍能量製造噪音或出聲的鬼魂，根據我的判斷通常是逗留在人間比較久的，比較了解能量運作的方式，好題外話，此時我靜靜地聽著並判斷著是不是自己多想，直至房間沒有動靜後再躺下睡覺，後來我決定再多觀察幾個禮拜。\n有了第一次之後，雖然有警覺心，但還是抱持著希望是自己多想的狀況下睡覺，雖然我的內心告訴我，八九不離十跟那東西有關，果然\u0026hellip;不出我所料，我最不期待的事情還是發生了，我天生的保護機制又再度喚醒我，我又再次聽到東西被移動的聲音、腳步聲之類的，而且越來越頻繁\u0026hellip;，這時我已經確認自己不是多想，而是跟那東西有關，儘管我的頭腦還是不願意相信，我們的頭腦就是這樣\u0026quot;固執\u0026quot;。\n一早，我聆聽內心的聲音先上網查資料，在Google搜尋我家的租屋地址，想看看我們家附近有沒有發生什麼事件，果不其然，還真的有！在我承租的這棟公寓大樓，在六年前曾經有發生女生為情跳樓自殺，我們這棟大樓只有5樓，而我住3樓，我是不知道祂是不是每層樓都逛逛還是只找我，總之根據我的資料調查，在六年前有個房東在頂樓加蓋一樓變成六樓，現在是不是拆除了我不知道，因為我也沒有上去證實過，承租的那段期間有想上去看一下，但想想還是算了，畢竟祂也沒有害我，也不知道祂是不是有\u0026quot;目的\u0026quot;找我。\n因為不只人類會上網，其實靈也會上網，所以各位無形的朋友們，先跟祢們說好啊，我沒有協助祢們回到光中的能力，我只有淨化跟驅離的能力，所以祢們來找我\u0026hellip;基本上只會被我強制驅離，因為祢們打擾到我的日常生活，不得已情況下只能這樣，若有得罪到祢們真的很抱歉，因為\u0026hellip; 我就只會這個能力，除非我的靈魂團隊有意讓我學習，否則我就只會這個，如果是要協助祢們回到光中，請找擁有這能力的人，總之目前的我是沒有的，所以不要找我。\n好，以上就是我的靈魂故事分享。\n","permalink":"https://ellielife.github.io/blog/2024%E5%B9%B4/2024.10.30%E6%88%91%E7%9A%84%E9%9D%88%E7%95%B0%E6%95%85%E4%BA%8B%E5%88%86%E4%BA%AB%E7%A7%9F%E5%B1%8B%E9%81%87%E9%AC%BC%E7%B6%93%E9%A9%97/","tags":null,"title":"我的靈異故事分享｜租屋遇鬼經驗(二)"},{"categories":["療癒日記"],"contents":"Hi，親愛的靈魂，\n我真不知道該說你是天真?還是傻?還是蠢?\n首先我知道你來自宇宙某星系高維度的某一個領域，否則不會有一顆很善良很大膽很大愛的心，大老遠跑來願意投身在一個與自己靈魂格格不入的家族和星球，然後又很重視自身的靈魂成長(一個把吃苦當吃補的靈魂)，在地球變成一個寧願自己受傷受苦也不願意讓別人受傷的人，因為心情會大受影響(因靈魂本身有很高的承受能力)，若可以的話，下一世我寧願當壞人，我要當壞人，哼哼哼。\n我今天就是控訴你，\n麻煩你下次決定投胎前，請慎重/慎選合作對象好嗎?我不管你是要幫助這家人還是這家族減輕業力?化解業力?或是幫助其他人?療癒其他人?我不在乎你在靈性層面要怎麼幫助，反正人類的我一定會參與其中，我也只能照做，但我不爽的是\u0026hellip;

靜心有兩種方式：\n1.靜態靜心 2.動態靜心 而我大多數時候都是使用動態靜心。\n靜態靜心是我腦子混亂或身體能量不穩時會使用的方法之一。\n第一次認識動態靜心這名詞是我看了奧修OSHO-100多種靜心方式，其中包括數種動態靜心，這是我在大學圖書館打工時看到的一本書，當時我正在整理書架上的書籍，剛好看到這本書，書名引起了我的注意和興趣，因為那時候的自己對身心靈的渴望已不在滿足書籍上的知識，而是渴望透過親身實踐的方式來探索這神祕的世界，於是我帶著實驗的目的借了這本書回宿舍。\n當時借這本書的最主要目的 ─ 通靈\n(先說明一點，除非你身心靈夠穩定，否則不要輕易嘗試。)\n當時我渴望接觸非生命存在體，我要親自驗證祂們的存在，儘管祂們已經給我很多的暗示和提示，但我的頭腦還是很頑固，我就是要親自驗證並且從祂們身上獲得那終極的奧秘。\n為什麼?因為我不明白通靈是怎麼運作的，為什麼世界上有人可以接觸到另一維度的世界，加上自己的奶奶也會通靈這件事讓我更加好奇，可能有些人會問為什麼不問你奶奶呢?因為我與奶奶存在至少有三代的文化隔閡和語言代溝，嚴格來說她是我的曾祖母，她只會說方語和日語(她有經歷過被日本殖民統治的時期)，而自己在方語和日語方面也不是很熟練，畢竟現在大家都是說國語居多，所以可以跟祖母溝通的詞彙很少。\n總之，在我的嘗試下，確實有成功通靈的親身經驗，所以也對通靈略知一二，我可以很誠實的告訴你們\u0026hellip; 祂們確實存在，但我現在沒有這麼做了，以後有機會有心情再寫一篇通靈經驗的分享以及當時身體上的一些變化。((有沒有人感興趣阿，哈哈！\n好啦，再次跟大家聲明一件事：我現在沒有做通靈這件事囉，而且我也沒有興趣再去做，因為我已經明白關於此生要不要開啟通靈技能，實際上是你的靈魂決定的，那可以後天培養嗎?答案是可以！因為我就是靠自己後天摸索，通靈後才明白根本與人類世界沒什麼兩樣，只不過更加的豐富和充滿神秘感(畢竟我還沒深入探索過)，我打算等靈魂決定適合的時機開啟後在摸索，不急，而且我也明白今生自己的任務目標在哪了，我的靈魂要我好好將靈性知識套用在生活裡，畢竟人類世界才是重點，很多人都不知道，在靈性的世界裡，有很多靈性存有將人類視作祂們的大明星呢，因為人類才是那個有能力改變這個世界的。\n所以，要好好的活在人類世界裡，體驗身為創造者的感受，體驗有限的生命，體驗喜怒哀樂，畢竟這在靈魂的世界裡是不曾有過的經驗，過好你自己的生活才是最重要的，對於靈魂來說，沒有什麼比在人類的世界裡修行更重要的了 ─ 以上都是我的肺腑之言。\n回歸正題，我主要是想表明動態靜心的優點 ─ 保持高專注力在同一件事情上\n為什麼這麼說呢?\n因為有段時間的自己與以前的自己有很大的差別，就是對同一件事的專注力不夠。小時候的自己，專注力很高，能夠馬上進入狀態，現在的自己總能被一些其他瑣碎事物打擾，尤其是划手機這件事，我明明是要查資料的，結果被其他事物所分心，例如會有一些小廣告吸引我的注意、YT的推薦影片等等\u0026hellip; 過了一陣子再回來查資料，都不知道浪費了多少時間。\n再來，間接利益就是能夠培養自己的穩定度，當你靈魂穩定度高了，人類的你也會間接的影響周圍的人們喔，你會帶動周遭的人們向上成長以符合你自身的頻率。\n我所使用的方法不是書籍上的方式，而是透過日常生活作息的方式，比方說做家事、寫字、畫圖等等，反正只要是有在\u0026quot;動\u0026quot;，就練習將注意力保持在當下，久而久之，你不需要刻意練習也能夠將注意力保持在當下，這也是活在當下的練習方法之一，而且對於創造者而言保持高專注力很重要呢，分享給大家囉。\n","permalink":"https://ellielife.github.io/blog/2024%E5%B9%B4/2024.10.20%E7%99%82%E7%99%92%E6%97%A5%E8%A8%98%E5%8B%95%E6%85%8B%E9%9D%9C%E5%BF%83--%E6%98%AF%E5%9F%B9%E9%A4%8A%E9%AB%98%E5%BA%A6%E5%B0%88%E6%B3%A8%E5%8A%9B%E7%9A%84%E5%BC%B7%E5%A4%A7%E6%96%B9%E6%B3%95/","tags":null,"title":"動態靜心

東網\n上網查長得像東南亞這件事，幾乎都是負面評論，\n真正體會過後才知道那是視野狹隘的人才會有的想法，\n現在我甚至覺得這是優點呢，哈哈哈哈。 有機會多認識一些不同國家的人也不錯。\n今天去買早餐時，排我後面的人是印尼人，為什麼我會知道呢?\n因為在我成長過程中總會有印尼或是菲律賓人來跟我說話，\n印尼人與菲律賓人講話的腔調不一樣，\n((天啊，居然分辨得出來，就知道我遇過很多次了吧，哈哈))\n而我也預料到當我轉頭那一刻，他鐵定會用他的語言跟我說話，\n因為當他排在我後面時，他就說著印尼語來引起我的注意，\n((因為他已經認定我是印尼人，且認為我會主動跟他攀談呢))\n也因為有這樣的成長經驗，我自己也知道自己長得像東南亞。\n小時候還蠻排斥的，\n因台灣社會的刻板印象是這些外籍移工都是比較次一等的人種，尤其是深色膚色的人，

我看得出來\u0026hellip;他很努力地讓我了解為什麼會遇到這個問題，以及日後遇到這些問題時要怎麼解決。\n其實在這之前，我就有聽到一些台灣人在講這位菲律賓人的壞話，\n說他不是很專業，以後若有遇到問題不要找他，要找台灣的。\n但這幾天與他共事的過程中，我觀察到他不是別人口中的他，\n他工作認真，會主動看看哪裡需要幫忙，而不是等別人開口，\n別人說他不專業，但我覺得不會，問的問題都答得出來，問題也都有被好好的解決，\n我甚至覺得我們才應該要向這些人好好學習，人家大老遠為了家人/小孩來這裡工作賺錢，\n甚至還要學中文，光這點我就覺得很厲害了，\n而且他沒有一些台灣主管的高姿態，他就蠻平易近人的，\n不知道是不是文化差異的關係，還是身處在他鄉就需要這樣低聲下氣，\n反正\u0026hellip;我不是很清楚，沒有很多與外國人一起工作的機會，所以也不知道這差異要歸類在哪裡。\n總之，我只是想表達自己觀察到的，他們真的還蠻好相處的，\n就比如今早遇到的印尼人就在我買完東西要離開時，還會主動跟我說拜拜。\n其實每次與他們談話時，我都可以感受到他們很熱切的情感以及想跟我交朋友，\n但聽到我說自己是台灣人時，他們都會禮貌地說聲抱歉，似乎冒犯到我，\n要是以前的自己會，還會擺臭臉，但現在不會了覺得沒差， 因為有機會的話可以做朋友，認識異國文化，學英文， 然後出國旅遊時，還可以請他們帶我們遊玩呢，

主要是在描述馬來西亞一對毫無血緣關係也沒有公民身份證的難兄難弟，是如何在殘酷的社會裡彼此互相依賴、互相給予支持，直到社工介入後\u0026hellip;的故事。\n我覺得導演王禮霖也是蠻有心的，雖說是一對兄弟，但其實命運大不同。\n哥哥，阿邦，無出生報，聾啞人士，無父無母、無身分證，連國籍都不被認可，艱辛長大之後他依然照顧著最親愛的弟弟，無論面對何種困境，都會為家人奮戰下去。\n弟弟，阿迪，有出生報(出生證明)是正常人，只要有去辦身分證，他的人生就可以逆天改命。但弟弟阿迪則不甘向命運低頭，個性好強，與習慣逆來順受的哥哥阿邦不同，他不願向社會制度低頭，決心用自己的方式求生存，經常衝動鬧事，讓自己身陷險境，也連帶影響了與他相依為命的兄弟。\n有興趣的可以去看看阿，我覺得蠻感人的，現在netflix有喔。 若你/妳是心理諮商師，大概會對這位法師很感冒。 有一幕我還蠻印象深刻的就是，當阿邦因為誤殺社工而入獄時，有位法師進來監獄想要開導他，但他講的每一字每一句都讓我覺得蠻好笑的，若這發生在我眼前，我真的會對他歷年來在宗教信仰上所吸收到的知識和這些形而上學的概念感到疑惑，因為\u0026hellip;當你想要開導人或是引導人走上正途時，有三個很重要的因素，然後第三點可有可無，當然有的話更棒！\n第一，你需要先了解『個案的背景』，例如:他的成長背景、目前的處境等等\u0026hellip;。\n第二，唯有當個案想要被療癒時，療癒才會發生。\n第三，你身邊是否有其他資源可提供實質性的幫助，或是你可以提供『具體的方法』來協助他們在不友善的生存環境裡好好的生活著，直到他們能夠在這個社會上站穩腳步。\n而不是在沒有了解個案的背景下，不斷說著那些心靈雞湯的話，說真的，當你不了解個案，你又怎麼能有同理心去體會個案經歷這些事情的心情跌幅，若你沒有與這些個案產生\u0026quot;心與心的共鳴\u0026quot;又怎麼能正確引導他們，世上有句話是\u0026quot;因材施教\u0026quot;，所以同樣地，對待不同的個案引導方式自然也不一樣，而不是千篇一律都是同個模式，還有一點，你心靈的廣度和深度是否如平靜的大海一樣，因為這取決於你能承受多少的負面能量，因不是每個人都喜歡與負面能量相處，若你細細品嚐負面能量，你會發現其實它是有重量的又帶點黏稠度，就像有個\u0026quot;不知名\u0026quot;的黑色液體黏在身上洗也洗不掉的感覺，讓人很不舒服，這就是為什麼心情會鬱悶的原因，這就是為什麼有些人不是很願意每天去承接來自身邊人的負面能量，因那會造成\u0026quot;心靈疲勞\u0026quot;，所以能夠當心靈療癒師和心理諮商師也是蠻不容易的，每天都要承受這些不屬於自己的負面能量，大多數人一定都不知道療癒師或是諮商師都會需要抽出時間來淨化自己，因為這些負面能量也是會影響到他們自身的，嚴重的話也是會連帶影響個人的運勢，所以有些擁有這些能力的人寧願只顧自己就好了，才不會出來\u0026quot;多管閒事\u0026quot;，畢竟他們要不要做也是出自於個人意願，若是指引別人這麼簡單的話，每個人都可以出來當心理諮商師或是療癒師了呢。\n剛好這部電影給了我們一個很嚴重的錯誤引導範例。\n當法師對阿邦說：『活著的時候就好好活著，就這麼簡單。』\n殊不知，這句話對阿邦來說是件很諷刺的話，引發了阿邦內在最深處的肺腑之言。\n你說，阿邦沒有好好的過生活嗎?有！\n他有想好好的活著嗎?有！\n他有想改變自己的生活嗎?答案是肯定的！\n無奈的是以他自身的條件來說很難，身為一位聾啞人士，無身分證明者，要如何在這個社會上立足?他每天除了要躲避警察過生活外也沒有辦法領政府的各種補助，他只能在社會的角落裡，在那個能接受他的角落裡自立自強好好的活著。\n有時候用文字表達的方式無法感受到那種情緒，所以我就來分享影片來感受一下，讓我們一起來欣賞由我們的影帝吳康仁所飾演的阿邦，這片段真的演得很棒，讓我好悲傷阿，真的讓我哭好久。\n很多時候，我們這些正常人大部分都認為生活很簡單，然而真的是這樣嗎?若生活可以好好過，為什麼一堆正常人過得不開心，甚至得了心理或是精神方面的疾病，例如憂鬱症和躁鬱症等等，更何況是生存條件對他們更不利的身障人士或是無國籍者，這些人他們真的願意過這樣的生活嗎?有些人甚至沒有『追夢』的權利。\n從阿邦的角度來看這世界，其實在他的內心深處是孤獨的，沒有人能夠理解他的處境，他是個聾啞人士，他無法像正常人一樣表達內心的情感需求，他無法好好的與人溝通，那種無法被理解的感受，使他封閉自己的心靈，加上他又是個無身分證者，即使渴望去擁有家、擁有愛、擁有極平凡人能夠擁有的一切，對他來說都是奢望的，他不敢想，也不願意去想要如何擁有這一切，因為至始至終這一切都是『無法被實現的夢想』，對他來說，他沒有未來，他的未來就是那個樣子，不會有什麼變化。\n所以，有時走在路上看到身障人士在賣一些小零食或是小型衛生紙等等其他生活用品，我都會捧場買一下，因我很欣賞他們靠著自己的努力去生活著，不像有些人好手好腳卻不好好工作著。\n永遠不要等到失去最親的人，才開始去學著成長。 電影的結尾，有悲傷也有令人欣慰的事情，那就是當弟弟知道哥哥被判死刑時，才開始醒悟一步一腳印地活著，這樣做的目的就只為了讓哥哥放心的離開，讓哥哥知道在沒有他的日子裡，他會努力把生活過得很好，不讓他擔心。最後一次弟弟去監獄探視哥哥時，阿邦從與弟弟對話的過程中發現弟弟已經改變了，不再是從前那個經常衝動鬧事，讓自己身陷險境的人，他那發自內心欣慰的心情顯於表時，這一幕也好感人喔。\n我和你雖沒有血緣關係，但我們的情感卻血濃於水。\n這一世雖相處短暫，但有緣與你相伴就已足夠。\n","permalink":"https://ellielife.github.io/blog/2024%E5%B9%B4/2024.10.02%E9%9B%BB%E5%BD%B1%E5%BF%83%E5%BE%97%E9%9B%BB%E5%BD%B1%E5%BF%83%E5%BE%97%E5%AF%8C%E9%83%BD%E9%9D%92%E5%B9%B4/","tags":null,"title":"電影心得｜

在你們人類社會中，外在的形象似乎有著強大的力量，但同時，它也是十分地膚淺，因為任何的外在形象都是虛幻的，只有一種無法被掩蓋，那就是你內在的核心本質，那才是唯一真實的，在靈性的世界裡，一切都隱藏不了，一看就知道誰在打腫臉充胖子。\n你去看看大自然的動植物，甚至是非生命存在體，牠們都清楚的知道自己是誰和了解自己的價值，並將這份價值服務整個大自然，換句話說，當你們人類了解到自我價值這個概念後，你們會激發自己內在靈魂攜帶下來的天賦，並將這份力量透過服務回饋給社會，可惜的是你們人類並不了解這一點，你們當今這世上\u0026quot;醒著\u0026quot;的人很少，只佔2%，\n所以，我親愛的孩子，真正的美，就像花朵一樣由內而外綻放，那是一種自然的過程，會在適當的時間點開花，這是無庸置疑的。\n你們人類有一句話:「真正變好的不是生活，是自己。」這句話的涵義很深奧，因為它包含了內在和外在，吸引力和創造力。\n自我價值≠社會角色帶來的價值 還有一點我想讓你明白，自我價值≠社會角色帶來的價值，當你根據內心的指引活出自己的內在價值時，附加價值就是社會角色帶來的價值。\n讓我舉個例子來說：\n如果今天你是一位董事長，你可以享受整個公司的人事和資源都任由你支配的權威感；\n如果今天你是一位法官，那你可以享受特權式的社會地位；\n如果今天你是位部長，您可以享受成為媒體的焦點與新聞人物。\n但是，這些都只是你的「社會角色帶來的價值」。它們跟我所說的「自我價值」，一點關係都沒有。\n現今這個社會，有太多人誤認為社會角色的價值跟自我價值是同個等號，但事實並非如此，一個擁有自我價值的人會全心全意的透過熱情和興趣工作，而非為了財富、權力、地位，因為他們清楚的了解自己的生命存在於自己的熱情與投入當中，他們了解自己是誰並清楚的知道自己是值得存在的，但這不怪大多數的你們，畢竟你們需要為了生存奮鬥，還有帷幕幈障在阻隔著你們，但之後這帷幕幈障會越來越稀薄，會有越來越多的人接觸到另一維度的世界，要小心人類世界靈性圈子的內亂，要懂得識別且靈性世界沒有你們想像中那麼的美好，比人類世界更複雜更快顯化，沒有一定的基礎能力，可是會被自己的顯化能力給搞死，且並不是所有的靈魂都是『善』的，也有不懷好意的，所以不管是人類還是靈性世界都要有保護自己的能力，這也就是為什麼你的靈魂寧願讓你吃苦，也要讓你成長的因素，你的靈魂在靈性的世界裡也在成長，所以不要去羨慕別人的生活過得一帆風順，別人有別人的靈魂旅程，你有你的靈魂旅程，專注在自己的靈魂旅程上就好了。\n","permalink":"https://ellielife.github.io/blog/2024%E5%B9%B4/2024.09.25%E7%99%82%E7%99%92%E7%AD%86%E8%A8%98%E8%87%AA%E6%88%91%E5%83%B9%E5%80%BC%E7%9A%84%E9%87%8D%E8%A6%81%E6%80%A7/","tags":null,"title":"療癒筆記｜自我價值的重要性"},{"categories":["塔羅日記"],"contents":"我昨天因為鼻子過敏發作，一整晚都睡不好，早上8點才睡，請假之前，我耗了2個小時都在思考\u0026hellip;今天要不要請假，因為我不是一個很喜歡請假的人，但我身體好累喔，昨晚又沒睡，今天去上班的話\u0026hellip;處理事情的效率不是很好之外，我怕自己可能趴在桌上睡覺了，後來因為拿不定主意，就乾脆拿塔羅來算一下，這裡先說明一點塔羅不會告訴你答案(例如:是或不是的肯定句)，只會『建議』你『應該』怎麼做，至於要不要做、要不要改變，主導權還是在你身上，畢竟你才是生命的主人，算完後，我為自己抽到的牌卡是教宗牌，看到這一張牌我笑了。\n塔羅的回答

儘管如此，她還是有好好地努力生活著，完成她這一生的使命。\n『對她來說，金錢毫無意義。』 — 這是我從她的視角中看到的最真切的感受。 這時靈魂視角關閉，她突然跟我說：『如果可以\u0026hellip;我希望妳在決定做一件事情之前，先去了解和規劃，不要理解到一半就一頭熱地栽進去，妳最大的缺點就是做事太衝動和去承擔不該是妳責任的事情，妳要記住妳的身體才是最大的財產，請好好愛惜妳自己的身體和愛妳自己，因為妳值得。』\n聽到她這句話，我就知道估計她也透過靈魂視窗看到我的成長背景，我和她有著非常不一樣的成長背景，從她的視角來觀看我這一生，她只想對我說的話竟然是請好好照顧自己的身體和好好的愛自己。\n噗，這句話連我最親密的家人都沒跟我說過呢。\n『是的，女王大人，小女子銘記在心❤️』 結語 她，什麼都有，卻沒有追逐夢想的權利；\n我，什麼都沒有，卻擁有追逐夢想的權利；\n或許，這就是為什麼我喜歡從無到有的過程吧。\n","permalink":"https://ellielife.github.io/blog/2024%E5%B9%B4/2024.09.16%E7%99%82%E7%99%92%E6%97%A5%E8%A8%98%E9%81%87%E8%A6%8B%E5%8F%A6%E4%B8%80%E6%99%82%E7%A9%BA%E7%9A%84%E6%88%91/","tags":null,"title":"遇見另一時空的我"},{"categories":["Boostrap5

主題顏色可以參考Boostrap5官網\n※可使用.navbar-light將導覽列設定淺色背景顏色。\n※可使用.navbar-dark將導覽列設定深色背景顏色。\n※可使用.bg-實用程式進行自訂。\n※以下是範例圖片 ※以下是範例程式碼\n\u0026lt;nav class=\u0026#34;navbar navbar-dark bg-dark\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;!-- Navbar content --\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/nav\u0026gt; \u0026lt;nav class=\u0026#34;navbar navbar-dark bg-primary\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;!-- Navbar content --\u0026gt;

\u0026lt;/nav\u0026gt; 3. 帶下拉菜單的導覽列 4. 固定在頁面頂部的導覽列 使用fixed-top類別可以將導覽列固定在頁面頂部。\n※可以套用在container語法裡，不一定要套用在.navbar上。\n\u0026lt;nav class=\u0026#34;navbar fixed-top navbar-light bg-light\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div class=\u0026#34;container-fluid\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;a class=\u0026#34;navbar-brand\u0026#34; href=\u0026#34;#\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Fixed top\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/nav\u0026gt; 5. 固定在頁面底部的導覽列 使用fixed-bottom類別可以將導覽列固定在頁面頂部。\n※可以套用在container語法裡，不一定要套用在.navbar上。\n\u0026lt;nav class=\u0026#34;navbar fixed-bottom navbar-light bg-light\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div class=\u0026#34;container-fluid\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;a class=\u0026#34;navbar-brand\u0026#34;

功能跟固定在頁面頂部一樣，不一樣的地方是若前面已先用第一個.container包裹起來的，那麼它的效果僅會浮動在第一個.container內，並不會隨著滑鼠滾輪往下後繼續浮動，要注意這一點。\n使用sticky-top類別可以將導覽列固定在頁面頂部。\n※可以套用在container語法裡，不一定要套用在.navbar上。\n※另請注意，.sticky-top使用position: sticky，並非每個瀏覽器都完全支援。\n\u0026lt;nav class=\u0026#34;navbar sticky-top navbar-light bg-light\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div class=\u0026#34;container-fluid\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;a class=\u0026#34;navbar-brand\u0026#34; href=\u0026#34;#\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Sticky top\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/nav\u0026gt; 7. 垂直導覽列（側邊欄） 8. 帶表單的導覽列

分享自商業周刊\n看了這則新聞，讓我想起曾經在餐飲業打工時，遇到一位19歲的小弟弟，我看他年紀輕輕就買百萬重機上班，我以為他是有錢富二代的小孩，有次跟他聊天時，他自爆其實他有經濟壓力，每個月領錢有部分需要幫忙家裡償還房貸，等於父親貸款買下的房子，現在變成他要去償還，於是我又問：『那你怎麼有錢買重機?』他：『我是在fb社團買二手的，只用60萬買下。』我：『那錢怎麼來的?』他：『貸款買的。』我：『你居然還敢貸款買，你現在生活過得還可以嗎?』他：『目前還可以拉，單身貴族生活，哈哈，沒辦法，我就喜歡。』\n聽到當下，笑了一下，年輕人終究只是年輕人，雖然我也沒好到哪裡去，但也讓我確信了一點，我要買房的話至少要等我有能力，因為我不想要債留子孫。\n買房=買資產? 我寧願租房，剩餘金錢平均分散在其他投資上 對我來說，與其貸款1000千萬買房子添購資產，我寧願租房子，剩餘的金錢拿去投資其他資產，分散風險還比較安全，要綁30年到50年，想想就覺得好可怕😵，而且天有不測風雨，還記得去年中國大陸的新聞，內容主要是在描述某位在企業擔任高管的年輕女孩自殺事件，為什麼會自殺?因為她從沒想過在她購買房子後的第五年，自己會有無預警被裁員的一天，房子的貸款一下子成為了她經濟上的負擔，直到她再也繳不起房貸被銀行變賣房子，她從有房到無房，最後受不了經濟的壓力選擇自殺，想想這中間的過程是承擔多少的壓力和重擔，所以\u0026hellip; 基本上我是不願意用這麼久的時間去添購一項資產，5年已經是我的極限了，對我來說，這麼做風險很高，我寧願將其他閒置資金拿來投資其他事項，這樣還比較穩定。\n我知道有些人就是想要有自己的房子，而且未來就算不要了也可以高價賣掉償還剩餘的貸款，再添購人生第二個房子，我的大學導師就是這樣操作的，房子越換越大，當然這得有好的理財知識，要懂得操作槓桿，現在想想不由得佩服我大學導師真的蠻厲害的，不過當時老師在分享她的經驗時我也沒有很注意聽，因為那時我對數學很反感，我就是不想算，現在有點後悔了，沒想到那堂課還蠻重要的。\n但每個人的考量不一樣，我的話寧願租房子，慢慢的累積資產，因為我知道自己要買的話會很挑剔，而且也會跟我未來的生活模式有很大的關聯，所以在不確定的情況下，我是不會輕易購買，現在買房有很大的風險，第一，台灣屬於地震頻繁的國家，現階段地質活動頻繁，誰知道買了後會不會被震垮，上次就有在新聞看到台北忘了哪區，因建案施工不當導致周圍鄰近地區地層下陷，還造成某棟房子不能住人，其中有一戶還是剛買房的第二年，你看，房子不能住了房貸還要繼續繳呢，第二、台灣少子化，未來的空屋會大於總人口，你確保這項投資會是穩賺不賠的嗎?當然也得看未來的政府針對房地產會有什麼的政策和方針。第三、氣候全球暖化導致海平面上升，現在買房還得看現在要住的地方會不會被海水淹沒呢。\n天啊\u0026hellip; 想想就覺得弊大於利，基本上我個人是不贊同房子用作於投資，因為我覺得每個人應該都要有一個基本的好的生存空間，想想古時候的人雖然很窮，但是住的地方卻很寬敞很大，雖然很簡陋，但是也不至於出現像香港蝸居族這樣的生活環境，看了就挺令人心疼的，現在買房看看那是什麼天價的價格，現在年輕人買不起，未來的年輕人更買不起，現在一坪70-100萬，未來可能一坪100-200萬，傻子才買呢，我才不要當傻子😛。\n以下分享香港的鍋居生活，親愛的人類阿，什麼時候才會醒醒? 分享自邦德看世界\n信不信由你，未來的聰明選擇會是自給自足的生活 你知道嗎?現在有些人選擇不和這個世界的資本主義玩遊戲，只想當這個世界的Bug，包括我。\n在我眼裡，資本主義已經嚴重傾斜了，它需要被『看的見的手』來調整天秤的平衡，以至於經濟市場不會亂了套，這就是資本主義的風險，對我來說社會主義和資本主義各有各地優點和缺點，但最終我認為最好的政策就是中間偏右的政策，為什麼?因為這世界本來就是不公平的世界，我們人類之所以有智慧就是拿來用在，在不公平的世界裡每個人都會機會去創造和改變自己想要的生活，我認為這就是人生最迷人的地方。\n當然，每個人的生活選擇不一樣，我未來想像中的生活就是自給自足生活，因為未來的生活成本會越來越高，大多數人為了抵抗通貨膨脹帶來的壓力會選擇過自給自足的生活，當然時代不一樣，用的手法就會不一樣，既然AI已出現在我們的生活裡，為何不用AI智慧和機器人來當我們的農夫呢，為我們栽種食物，誰說我們要親自種呢，哈哈哈，只不過會需要燒掉一些錢，不過沒關係，益大於弊，讓AI成為我們的智慧生活小幫手不好嗎?我們還可以做其他事情呢。\n","permalink":"https://ellielife.github.io/blog/2024%E5%B9%B4/2024.09.09%E7%94%9F%E6%B4%BB%E6%97%A5%E8%A8%98%E6%96%B0%E9%9D%92%E5%AE%89%E6%94%BF%E7%AD%96-%E8%B2%B7%E6%88%BF%E7%9C%9F%E7%9A%84%E6%98%AF%E6%9C%80%E5%A5%BD%E7%9A%84%E9%81%B8%E6%93%87%E5%97%8E/","tags":null,"title":"新青安政策｜買房真的是最好的選擇嗎?"},{"categories":["來點好玩的"],"contents":"【塔羅牌占卜】0902至0928週運勢

從牌面上的訊息來看，這一週你們會過得很充實，讓你們原本無聊的生活變得不再無聊，尤其是對於近期有在考慮轉換跑道的朋友們來說，你們不得不暫停思考自己是否還有其他的可能性和發展，因為會有一些臨時的工作業務需要你們幫忙和分擔，另外，有些朋友有機會被公司提拔和加薪喔，而有些朋友會因為被提拔轉換到公司其他業務部門，但不用擔心，你們有塔羅最好的王牌—太陽牌坐鎮，所以這個領域會是你得心應手的，會是你拿手的，就算是新接觸的領域也不用擔心，你們會自動轉換成自我學習模式，邊工作邊學習，在這邊有看到你們本來就是一群很聰明的人，本身學習力和理解力很好，剛好有部門主管看見你們身上的優點覺得這個位置適合你們，所以提拔你們給你們機會展示自我。\n但不管有沒有被升職加薪，本週還是要小心職場上的小人，還是會有小人故意跟你唱反調或是不願意配合你們，尤其是那些突然被調到其他部門的朋友們來說，但也不用擔心，這對於你們來說是小Case，無須在意，因為你們本來就是一群樂觀開朗的人，對於人際關係的處理有自己一套模式，所以基本上不會造成你們太大的困擾。\n這裡有些額外訊息是提供給想要轉換其他跑道的人：\n牌卡在這裡要鼓勵你們，這段期間很適合去學習和發展其他的興趣和愛好，如果還沒找到的，那就多多去探索和接觸，一定會找到自己喜歡的，不要給自己太大的壓力，選擇這組的你們本身就很優秀，一旦你們找到了，就會知道自己要往哪個方向發展了。\n宇宙給第一組的訊息

從牌面上來看，選擇第二組的朋友們，不管你們的運勢如何，你們總有那種人定勝天的感覺，所以基本上運勢對你們這組朋友而言聽聽就好，我的直覺告訴我，與其說你們的運勢，到不如說說你們的特點以及需要注意的事情。\n在抽牌的時候，我感應到你們跟第一組一樣是個很活潑開朗的人，但不一樣的是你們的精神很飽滿充沛，特別的有自信，你們很聰明，善於情報搜集，規劃/企劃和學習，同時創造力和靈感也不錯，不排除有些人口才也很棒，是個能夠同時處理很多事情的人，但你們有一個致命缺點，就是你們對自己太有自信，又或者是有時你們關注的事情太多，做事太急又缺乏耐心，本該好好的規劃卻沒有，導致原本可以做100分的事情，最後變成只能做80分或是70分這樣，牌卡要我提醒你們這點，這是不好的習慣喔，如果想讓自己變得更好，這點需要改進喔。\n宇宙給第二組的訊息

二、確立你最重要的目標 首先，你需要先建立自己「10個願望清單」，說說自己為什麼想要變得有錢。\n第二，從這10個願望清單中，挑選出最重要的3個。\n為什麼我們需要先建立願望清單?\n因為大多數的我們其實都弄不清楚自己真正想要的是什麼，他們只知道自己想要更多的東西。想像一下，如果你寄信給一家大型郵購商店，只說你想要『很多東西』，他們肯定沒辦法寄給你；所以我們必須清楚知道自己內心的願望，知道它是什麼，才能有可能得到它。\n為什麼我們需要挑選出最重要的3個\n因為我們要了解一個人的時間、精力和賺取的金錢是有限的，所以我們必須優先專注在最重要的事情上面，其他願望可以先緩緩沒關係。\n三、為你的目標建立「夢想存錢筒」和「夢想相簿」。 要達成願望需要三件事： 為你的夢想建立夢想相簿 每天都要看幾遍相簿，盡情想像自己願望實現的樣子 為你的夢想準備夢想存錢筒 前面第一件事和第二件事，談到一個很重要的概念是「視覺化練習」，書中說這是大部分成功人士都在使用的技巧，我相信，因為阿諾的自傳也說過自己也經常使用「視覺化」來達成他的夢想，我小時候也常使用這個技巧，也就是在腦中模擬一遍自己要如何解決問題以及如何一步一步達成自己的目標，有時我也會運用在數學的空間計算中，你知道嗎?當你可以「視覺化」你的夢想和目標時，那就代表你「辦得到！」，因為你辦不到的事情是無法視覺化出來的。套一句靈性的語言，任何你能夠『想像得到』的事物，其實在其他的平行宇宙或是你無限的輪迴投胎次數中，你『曾經』就做過類似的事情，所以你可以在腦中想像得出來，很玄吧，哈哈。 這就是為什麼我喜歡看畫展的原因，因為那些是畫家們將自己的內在視野展現出來給大家看的樣子，我們稱之為藝術，看著不同畫家呈現出來的畫風就覺得很神奇。\n好啦，題外話，當你為你的夢想建立夢想相簿並且每天去「視覺化」它時，你會為你的目標/夢想注入意念，然後用你的生命力去澆灌它、培養它、看著它成長，應該說會與它一起成長茁壯，曾經我就有這樣的經驗，所以很了解，如果你真的很想要，你會迫不及待排除萬難的去行動，直到你達成夢想。\nNo Plan B, Plan B就是執行A計畫\n這裡要談到一個概念，就是當你下定決心要為目標付出行動時，不要抱著「試試看」的心情，因為如果你抱著試試看的態度，就代表你已經有悲觀和消極的預期心理了。這就跟阿諾所說的『No Plan B, Plan B就是執行A計畫』的概念是一樣的，阿諾認為Plan B就是為無法達成A計畫找藉口、找理由，他絕不容許這件事發生，他認為事實上Plan B根本就不需要存在，要做就給我去做，要馬乾脆就不要做。噗，這就是我喜歡阿諾的原因，霸氣，我喜歡。哈哈哈😊\n我們要拿錢來做什麼?\n書裡有一句話我覺得不錯：『錢賺的多少不是最關鍵的，更重要的是：我們要拿錢來做什麼。我們必須學會好好和手上擁有的金錢打交道，這樣才有資格得到更多。』\n是阿，關鍵是我們要拿錢來做什麼?\n我覺得這問題不錯耶，每個人應該都要問自己這樣的問題。\n對我而言，這句話點醒了我，讓我意識到我就是金錢的主人，不是金錢的奴隸。\n彷彿在對我說：\n哈囉，親愛的。你不要搞錯方向了，賺錢不是你來到人世間的主要目的，事實上人的一生根本就無需這麼多錢，重點是『你賺那麼多錢要幹嘛?』，What\u0026rsquo;s your

一、首先，要確定金錢對你來說代表什麼 要明白，金錢是影響我們生活幸福指數之一，它與我們生活息息相關，我們不應該忽視它，因為忽視=向生活投降，所以當你不關注自己的財務狀況時，那麼金錢就會成為生活中特別消極的負面力量，而且會大大降低我們的生活品質。\n請告訴我，金錢對你來說代表什麼? 我的家庭就與書中的小女孩一樣，父母親總是為金錢的問題所煩惱，尤其是我母親，總是抱怨父親工作不夠努力，錢就賺不多了還一直請客，小孩是不用吃飯嗎?不用繳學費嗎等等\u0026hellip;我母親生起氣來會化身為黑人歌手，就像唱R\u0026amp;B一樣滔滔不絕，我真心覺得這項技能很厲害，我父親被唸到最後也不想跟我媽談話，就去做自己的事情或是離開家去找朋友去了，這一幕真的很常上演在我家的日常生活中。\n仔細回想，自己其實還蠻討厭金錢的，因為它帶給我們家的能量好沉重，父母親吵架，小孩也過得不開心，它可以是讓兩個相愛的人到最後演變成反目成仇的人，所以我認為情侶/夫妻之間只要是牽扯到金錢問題，就一定要重視，觀念不一樣沒關係，至少雙方要冷靜彼此溝通達成共識，一起攜手合作共同創造美好的未來，懂得利用金錢上天堂，反之則下地獄。\n說的好像有點遠了，哈哈，總之因自己是在貧窮家庭長大的，所以本來就沒有理財這方面的知識，自然而然金錢對我來說就不是那麼重要，即使我知道金錢很重要這件事。\n曾經有想要好好掌握住，有段時間有好好的理財，但總有各式各樣的原因，金錢總是從我身邊溜走，讓我越來越有心無力，直到最後我整個放棄去試圖掌控它，但當我越來越不關注它時，我的生活並沒有往前走，反而有種原地踏步或是越來越遭的感覺，所以我決定重新打掉重練，重零開始學習理財知識，我認為一定是自己以前的理財觀念有出問題，需要被改變或是糾正，這樣我的錢才會留住，並為我生出許多的金雞蛋XDD\n所以金錢對我來說是什麼?\n是個可以實現我很多願望的東西，並且幫助我成為更好的人。\n我不期許自己就像中樂透一樣擁有很多錢很快達成夢想，那種對我來說很不切實際。\n上帝說過:『你是，你所是，你只能吸引與你頻率相近的人事物，所以你要吸引富足，你本身就\u0026quot;是\u0026quot;富足，若你要吸引幸運，你本身就\u0026quot;是\u0026quot;幸運，就像太陽本身就是太陽，光彩奪目生命力豐盛，所以從來變好的不是生活，而是你自己，唯有你主動改變，你身邊的人事物才會跟著你轉變。』\n所以我比較喜歡在過程中體驗生活越來越美好的感覺，那種從無到有的感覺很棒，當生活越來越美好的同時我們也正在成為更好的人，對我來說，它是一項重要的指標，告訴我有沒有在往自己心目中想要的生活和想要成為的人前進。\n","permalink":"https://ellielife.github.io/blog/2024%E5%B9%B4/2024.08.30%E6%8A%95%E8%B3%87%E7%90%86%E8%B2%A1%E5%B0%8F%E7%8B%97%E9%8C%A2%E9%8C%A2/","tags":null,"title":"閱讀筆記｜小狗錢錢(一)"},{"categories":["生活日記"],"contents":" 作為一位曾經喜歡電玩的愛好者，看到中國出了個《黑神話·孫悟空》這個遊戲，大致看了一下遊戲的開場白，言不由衷的興奮，因為看的出來遊戲團隊對這部遊戲的用心，他們是真的下血本在開發以及製作，不得不說這部遊戲真做得很成功，透過遊戲把中國古代文學作品發揚光大，《西遊記》是中國古代神魔小說之一，同時也是中國家喻戶曉的文學作品之一。有興趣的可以去玩這個遊戲喔，因為可以透過遊玩遊戲去讀故事。\n中國人才輩出，可惜生錯時代，革命時代已到來，『自由』將會是中國新生代的聲音。 其實早在6-7年前，我就知道其實中國真的有很多優秀的青年和人才，為什麼會知道呢?因為那時候我正在找免費的教學網，無意間連到中國最大網的免費教學網，裡面真的很多人都是『無私』的奉獻自己的所學，我大致逛了一下這個網站，真的是\u0026hellip;要學什麼都有，套用一句他們的話：『牛逼！』，反觀看看台灣那時候的風氣，我覺得就是太平盛世的那種感覺，沒什麼競爭意識和國際意識，當然連我也是，但我可以從這個教學網感受的出來他們的職場競爭很激烈，自己若沒有一點本領的話真的很難的被錄用。\n再加上，那時候自己創業接觸電商這個領域，在與中國人接觸的過程中，我真心覺得中國人真的很聰明，至少在電商這個領域他們讓我認識到有很多新鮮的手法去吸引買家，但後來我看到電商在未來其實就是窮途末路，小型賣家很難跟大型賣家競爭，當然還有多原因，以後有機會再說，我只知道這條路無法再繼續走下去了，於是我在適當的時候關閉了這條道路，不過俗說話，當上帝關了你一道門，自然也會開啟另一道門，那時遇到了一些事情，我看見了另一條我能夠走的道路，那是我與生俱來就擁有的東西，上帝在呼喚我回到原有的道路，那是一條我不是很願意走的路，對我這個金牛座來說，很不靠譜阿，哈哈哈。上帝真的很會開玩笑。\n好啦，扯遠了，我只不過是想表達中國真的很多人才，不要看這個國家表面上好像什麼都沒有，但是上帝已經允諾『東方的雄獅會崛起』這件事是必然的，歐美總是要對抗中國，例如:限制晶片給中國，圍堵中國電動車等等\u0026hellip; 我可以很理解歐美大國這麼做的原因，但這也只是時間的問題，這麼做只會讓中國快速崛起更加強大而已，因為背後有一群有能力搬遷到國外的中國人才，因為『愛國』才留下來的，他們不願意自己的國家在最黑暗的時刻背棄而離，因為中國是他們的根、他們的本，這是他們奮鬥的原因，他們這一群是中國最亮、最美麗的星星。\n當然，中國崛起是需要付出代價的，總是想要武統台灣，在那之前\u0026hellip; 我覺得先管好自己國家內部的政權問題比較重要吧，我只能說當它崛起的時候，中國給世界的全新面貌將會是自由民主，願意跟任何國家合作的友好國家，這是它的轉變。((希望小粉紅\u0026hellip;

大約5-6歲左右吧，實際年齡有點忘了，放學後用身上僅存的100元去買零食，然後去奶奶家玩，到奶奶家之後，發現一個人影都沒有，大家都不在家，就連奶奶也不知道去哪裡了，於是我把找來的零錢放在大客廳漂亮的大理石桌上，我很喜歡這張桌子，橙灰色相間的顏色看起來很時尚高級，然後我隨興坐在奶奶家舒適的沙發上，不知道過了多久，應該說我不知道自己放空了多久，突然間，似乎有什麼東西在我眼前移動，當我看過去那一剎那，有點不敢相信自己剛剛看到的畫面，居然是剛放在桌上的錢幣自己移動，震驚之餘，同時間也安慰自己，有可能是小蟲子、小動物飛過去才造成視覺錯亂，畢竟我住的地方是鄉下，有小動物、小蟲子爬來爬去、飛來飛去很正常，當我這樣想時，下一秒，那個硬幣直接狠狠地推翻我的邏輯推理，它\u0026hellip;真的大喇喇地在我眼前移動，而且這次移動的幅度很大，直接掉在地上發出金屬與地板碰撞的聲音，此時我的腦袋還不敢相信剛剛看到的這一切，超乎腦袋理解範圍之外：剛剛那個是錯覺嗎?錢幣真的自己移動嗎?我剛剛看到的是真的嗎?如果這是真的\u0026hellip;，到底是什麼原因?可奶奶家的桌子是四平八穩的大理石，根本就沒有左右不平衡的問題，若是真的不平穩，其他的錢幣也應該一起移動掉下來才對，怎麼會是只有一枚硬幣?到底是什麼原因呢?就在這時\u0026hellip;.

因為居家環境是我們每天與這個環境互動相處的地方，一個負面的環境和磁場會影響人，同理，人的磁場也是會影響環境的。 世界上只有一種人能夠不被環境影響，就是那種內心很清淨且穩重的人，只有這種人才能跨過環境的障礙不被受影響，但大多數地球上的我們，內心都沒有到達那種程度，所以很容易被周遭的人事物影響。\n相信很多人都不知道，我們人類每天都會產生負面的能量或說是負面的情緒垃圾，比方說上班的壓力、人際關係的煩惱、金錢的壓力等等，甚至是你出門後也會把別人的負面情緒垃圾帶回家，而這些負面情緒垃圾會隨機掉落在居家環境各個地方，如果你平日不打掃，不保持環境的整潔和空氣(能量)流通，最終這些負面能量累積起來也是會影響居住在裡面的我們，所以平日打掃很重要，對外窗不管是下雨天還是晴天都要保持暢通，讓風進來把這些負面能量吹走，大自然會將這些負面能量轉換成其他形式。\n但若你都不抽空打掃居家環境，家裡總是推很多的雜物和物品，例如有很多該丟卻不丟的紙箱或是推了很多平常都用不到的東西，其實很容易招來阿飄喔，家裡啥時候有個阿飄都不知道呢，更何況是跟祂們朝夕相處，哈哈。尤其是有物品囤積症的要小心阿，不要以為家裡有阿飄沒事，其實久而久之還是會對人造成影響。\n所以，固定時間清掉那些已不再對自己有益的東西很重要，而且當你東西沒有那麼多的時候，其實你的思考會變得很清晰，會比較沒有那麼多的雜訊。另外，如果你是個比較偏向負面的人，想要改變自己不要那麼負面，先從環境上下手，為自己打造一個舒適的居家環境，除了心情好以外，慢慢地會淺移默化、由內而外的改變你這個人。\n若你是在外租房子，選擇一個好房間真的很重要！ 在外面租房子，真的不要懶惰，多去看看不同的房子，如果預算夠的話，最好找個有對外窗且有陽光照進來的地方，對我來說，最好要有個陽台，原因只因為我喜歡種花、種植物，這可能傳承自我媽的內在基因，打從我有記憶以來我就看到我媽都會種一些不知是什麼品種的花，小時候不明白為什麼母親要種這些植物，甚至覺得是浪費空間，直到有天我看見這些植物內在的生命力，我覺得很神奇，搞得我也開始種植物，不過我都是種吃的，哈哈。順帶一提，植物會吸收我們人體產生的負面能量喔，所以家裡有顆植物除了美觀環境外也能夠淨化居家環境，不妨也可以考慮一下。\n為你自己創造能夠產生正面影響力的環境，讓這個地方成為你生命力的地方。 如果你能為自己的居家環境保持一個正能量的循環，會多了一個屬於你自己靈魂的味道，除了環境會有能量清晰的味道外，自己身上也會散發屬於你自己的靈魂味道，每個人都不一樣，像我的好朋友曾經跟我說過：『你身上有一種木頭味，不過那種木頭味不是臭的，是一種很獨特的香氣，我不知道該怎麼形容，總之不是臭的，不要誤會我的意思。』我當下很納悶，通常都是髮香或是衣服上的香味或香水味，怎麼會是木頭味，於是我問她：『為什麼你會覺得是木頭味?』她：『我直覺就是樹木的味道。』嗯\u0026hellip;經她這麼一說，我突然想起曾經也有人跟我說過和我朋友一樣的話，說我身上有一種木頭味，本來我還不在意的說，好吧，我是大自然的孩子，多了一個木頭味也OK，反正不是臭的，直到後來因緣際會，偶然聽到某位在YT經營的靈性前輩說，每個人的靈魂味道不一樣，但如果你的香氣是木頭味，那表示你的靈性天賦很高。我聽到當下，只產生了一句疑問詞，是嗎?但我不覺得耶，哈哈。\n當然，對一個能量敏感的人來說，平日照顧自己的居家環境也是給自己設立一個能量防護牆，無形中會給這個環境空間設立一個空間結界，這個結界就是告訴那些無形的阿飄們，這裡有人住囉，這裡有人在打理喔，不要擅自闖入喔。一般情況下，這些阿飄和魔都不會輕易靠近，唉啊，能量療癒師都在使用的防護結界被你們知道啦，所以為你自己創造能夠產生正面影響力的環境很重要喔，讓這個地方充滿你生命力的地方。\n對我來說，整理環境有四大好處。 首先，第一，除了可以活動筋骨以外，還可以聽喜歡的音樂。第二，訓練自己將意識專注在當下外，同時訓練自己對同一件事保持高度的專注度，畢竟現代有太多讓我們分心的人事物了，我覺得現代人很需要的是對同一件事保持高度的專注度，不然馬上就要被另一件事給分心了。第三，當然就是如我標題所說的，吸引好運來到你身邊。第四，設立空間結界，讓那些妖魔鬼怪不要影響到自己的能量。\n以下分享我整理環境時喜歡聽的音樂，希望你們也會喜歡。\n","permalink":"https://ellielife.github.io/blog/2024%E5%B9%B4/2024.07.30%E7%99%82%E7%99%92%E6%97%A5%E8%A8%98%E5%90%B8%E5%BC%95%E5%A5%BD%E9%81%8B%E7%9A%84%E6%96%B9%E6%B3%95%E4%B9%8B%E4%B8%80%E7%B6%AD%E6%8C%81%E5%B1%85%E5%AE%B6%E7%92%B0%E5%A2%83%E7%9A%84%E6%95%B4%E6%BD%94/","tags":null,"title":"吸引好運的方法之一：維持居家環境的整潔。"},{"categories":["療癒日記"],"contents":"

當我聽到這句話時，我笑了。但我不想跟這樣的人爭執，所以我微笑不說話。\n確實，我在原住民裡面，我的長相是最平庸的，我的五官不是最漂亮最深邃的，甚至長得不像他們，但那又如何，我本來就不注重外貌，關於男女之間的事，關於受歡迎這件事，對我而言吸引力沒有很大，從某方面來說反而是一件困擾，因為我不喜歡活在聚光燈底下，我喜歡無憂無慮地做自己，當我身邊的女孩們都在學習如何打扮自己、如何讓自己變得更漂亮、更有吸引力時，我跟男孩們一起玩耍，不論是打棒球，打電動等其他運動遊戲，或是在課業上彼此競爭等等樣樣都來，對於要注重外貌這件事，從小我就不怎麼在意，我媽也沒教過我女人要愛漂亮，只對我的功課有要求。\n從小我就有被人家說醜，本來不以為意直到暗戀的對象要畢業了，老師要我們上台跟這些學長姐握手說再見，我很興奮很高興，因為可以握到喜歡的人的手，我覺得這是上帝給我的機會，當下真的很開心，但他卻拒絕跟我握手，因為他知道我喜歡他，當時對我的打擊真的很大，我當時想自己的外貌有這麼差嗎?因這件事的發生，至少有四年的時間我把自己封閉起來，那段日子我過得不是很開心，過的沒有比以前自信，直到有天上廁所時某個學姐跟我說:『你知道嗎?我們班有人喜歡你耶！還在考卷上寫你的名字，哈哈哈！』\n聽到的當下是蠻高興的，因自己沒想到長這麼醜還有人喜歡我、暗戀我，簡直不可思議，我知道那個人是誰，他的打掃區域是我每天要去打掃時的必經之路，我從沒跟他講過話，他也沒主動跟我說過話，但我有特別注意到他，因為他的個性在某方面與我很像，甚至是個比我還害羞的人，因為有次我跟他視線對上時，他特意別過我的眼睛看別的地方，當下覺得這舉動很奇怪，但也沒在意，當我知道他喜歡我時是蠻驚訝的，因為我不知道自己身上哪一點吸引他，尤其我是大家公認很醜的女孩，不過我很謝謝他，這麼醜的女孩他居然還願意公開表示喜歡我這件事，讓我重拾了自信。\n還有剛升上國一時，剛入學不到一個禮拜，自己跟同學正要回到教室時，有位學長叫住了我，我回頭看了下，當下的想法是我到底做了什麼壞事，為什麼學長帶一大堆人來找我，是要找我幹架是不是，結果是來跟我要聯繫方式的，聽到他跟我要聯繫方式時我還覺得自己是不是聽錯了。回到教室時，我一直在偷笑，因為我沒想到怎麼有男孩這麼可愛，怕被拒絕帶兄弟來助陣。\n經歷這兩件事讓我明白，不管你的長相如何，總有人會喜歡你和欣賞你。 而且我的經歷告訴我，有些人說你不漂亮時，那是謊言，事實是他們想打擊你，想讓你沒自信，因為你過的比他們耀眼，你身上一定有一些特質是他們羨慕和嫉妒的，所以，當有人告訴你不漂亮時，告訴你很醜時，那不是事實，事實是不管你的長相如何，在這世界上一定有人會被你吸引，想靠近你，喜歡你和欣賞你，你的存在某部分是為了他們而存在的，你的美要為他們綻放，所以不管別人怎麼說，愛自己就對了，儘管綻放自己的美，氣死那些人，哈哈哈😂😂😂。\n","permalink":"https://ellielife.github.io/blog/2024%E5%B9%B4/2024.07.11%E7%99%82%E7%99%92%E6%97%A5%E8%A8%98%E6%9C%89%E4%BA%BA%E8%B7%9F%E4%BD%A0%E8%AA%AA%E4%BD%A0%E4%B8%8D%E6%BC%82%E4%BA%AE/","tags":null,"title":"當有人跟你說你不漂亮時，那不是事實，事實是他們想打擊你，所以做好自己，盡情展現你的美，氣死他們，哈哈"},{"categories":["靈性書寫傳訊"],"contents":"若我今天是公司的總裁，只要你敢跟我提出你的想法，不論你的職階是什麼，只要你提出的改善計畫或是發展新的業務項目，經過評估是有發展的潛力，擁有可變現的價值，可以試試看的話，我會毫無保留的支助你，提拔你為該項目的負責人，你想怎麼做就怎麼做，我不會干涉。\n若我今天是個富豪，那麼我會換個方式，第一種方式:我買你的Idea，你成為我的顧問；第二種方式:與你合作，我出錢你出力。唯一的條件就是，若你成功了，我可是要49%分紅權，但若你失敗了，也無彷。\n只要對這世界的發展是好的，有益的，資源永續發展，我會豪無保留的投資，但很可惜我不是富豪，哈哈😂。\n現今這個世界最需要的是創意的想法，賺大錢需要創意的想法，現有公司要在未來站穩腳步需要創意的想法，要解決當今的問題也需要創意的想法，我們需要用它來改變這個世界，需要它來突破現有的狀況，需要它來解決地球許多問題，需要它來集結來自世界各地的優秀人才幹大事，如果政府無法達成我們人民的期望，那我們社會民間企業/團體也可以成為一股新興的勢力來改善這個情況，成為穩定國家的力量，甚至成為這個世界的超新星。\n我們無法想像一個天才的想法價值有多少，無法估量。\n","permalink":"https://ellielife.github.io/blog/2024%E5%B9%B4/2024.07.07%E7%8F%BE%E5%9C%A8%E9%80%99%E4%B8%96%E7%95%8C%E6%9C%80%E5%80%BC%E9%8C%A2%E7%9A%84%E4%B8%8D%E6%98%AF%E8%B2%A1%E5%AF%8C%E8%80%8C%E6%98%AF%E4%BD%A0%E7%9A%84idea/","tags":null,"title":"現在這世界最值錢的不是財富，而是你的Idea"},{"categories":["療癒日記"],"contents":"冥想VS靜心 比起通靈接觸諸佛菩薩、妖魔鬼怪等其他非物質存有或是冥想光和愛，我比較喜歡靜心，比較喜歡將腦袋放空，單純地將意識聚焦在感受自己身上，只有在這個時刻，我可以感受到自己是喜悅的，這份喜悅來自靈魂深處，臉上的笑容會不自覺的揚起，我可以感受到身體的能量是否平衡以外，運氣好的話還會感受到意識擴展的感覺，每個人意識擴展的體驗不一樣，像我有次經驗是突然意識到自己是生命的創造者，我以生命創造者的視角觀看自己目前所處的環境和空間，然後意識到這些被我吸引而來的人事物，不論是我喝的飲料、所使用的筆、平日的飲食習慣、平常的穿著打扮等，從某方面來說，實際上都代表著某一部分的『我』，不論好與壞，以靈魂的角度來看沒有區別，有的只是體驗，而在那個當下，我體驗到更多的愛從靈魂深處湧出，像噴泉一樣滔滔不絕，當我帶著愛看著周圍的人事物時，同時也感覺到自己也被周圍的愛所環繞，在那一刻我了解到自己是永恆的存在、永生不息、永生不滅。\n但更多時候，我比較喜歡搭配身體的伸展拉筋運動，因為我可以更多地感受身體的能量哪裡阻塞了，身體有哪些部分可能有什麼樣的狀況需要注意，當我更多的與自己身體相處，它會告訴我更多有關於身體方面的資訊，像是近期不要太常吃垃圾食物、要多吃什麼食物、要多喝水等等，當然這些訊息不是『說』的，比較像是意念傳達的感覺，當我們越常跟自己的身體相處時，會與自己的身體產生一種連結，也可以說是一種默契，有時不需要做拉身運動就知道身體在傳達什麼警訊，而且這樣做還有一個好處就是可以代謝掉很多不好的負面情緒，比方說上班的壓力、人際關係的壓力或者是來自周遭人給你的壓力等等，總之，靜心對我來說，益處多多。\n靜心讓我知道善待生命的第一課就是善待自己的身體，身體是自我一個重要的部分，不喜歡自己或者不珍惜自己身體的人，從心理層面分析就是不接納自己，以前我很不注重身體的健康，比較注重心理的健康，殊不知當身體出狀況時，才知道唯有健康的身體，才會有更健康的心理，兩者相輔相成，缺一不可。\n","permalink":"https://ellielife.github.io/blog/2024%E5%B9%B4/2024.06.26%E7%99%82%E7%99%92%E6%97%A5%E8%A8%98%E5%86%A5%E6%83%B3vs%E9%9D%9C%E5%BF%83%E6%88%91%E5%80%8B%E4%BA%BA%E6%AF%94%E8%BC%83%E5%96%9C%E6%AD%A1%E9%9D%9C%E5%BF%83/","tags":null,"title":"冥想VS靜心，我個人比較喜歡靜心"},{"categories":["靈性書寫傳訊"],"contents":"

大家都要捲起袖子忙起來囉XDD，不知道有些人有跟我一樣的感受嗎?，我在10月份時已感覺到我活在明年裡了，我已感覺到冥王星的能量所帶給我的衝擊了，但我並不排斥，反而有點興奮呢\n首先，為什麼我說2024年會是人類歷史上重要轉折點的開始呢?這說起來有點複雜，但我不想把它說得很複雜，簡單來說這跟星象有關，若要深入一點就與宇宙規劃有關，我知道有些人不相信，沒關係的，可以聽看看也好，不知道在這裡閱讀的人知不知道這個時代被稱為是末法時代，所謂的末法時代就是這可能是人類最後一個紀元，這個時代被稱為是最好的時代同時也是最壞的時代，為什麼這麼說呢?因為這時代的資訊是最多的，機會也是最多的，只要你有想法，只要動動手指就可以得到自己想要的資訊，想想我們每天都活在資訊爆炸的生活裡，滑一滑手機就有很多資訊衝擊著我們，不知不覺就會影響我們的所知所想，而且有些資訊是假的，若沒有辨別真假的能力真的很容易被影響，再加上人類的科技越來越發達，而我們究竟會創造什麼樣的科技呢?是讓科技為我們效力呢，還是讓科技毀滅我們人類，不由得而知，沒有人知道接下來會發生什麼，因為接下來只會是更加的混亂，但值得慶幸的是從明年開始會有越來越多人踏入身心靈這個領域，因為地球需要許多心態穩定的人來平衡衝突和混亂的能量，綜觀我們這個世界，從俄羅斯和烏克蘭的戰爭、以哈戰爭、美中衝突、全球環境議題等等\u0026hellip;甚至在未來還會再看到更多的社會運動，而這些都被某些預言書給預料到了，就我接觸過最早的預言書籍是198X年的，現今這個情況居然有80%都命中，不由得佩服這些有能力預見未來的人，他們出書發出警告同時也提出一些觀點可以解決末法時代的問題，我是覺得其實可以嘗試看看，其中一個辦法就是顧好自己就可以了，只要顧好自己就在幫這個世界一點忙了，因為地球需要許多許多許多心態穩定的人來平衡地球失衡的能量，以至於狀況不會繼續惡化下去，當然，若還有多餘的一點能力和心力，也是可以幫其他人的，現階段的話我覺得還是顧好自己最重要。\n若以能量學來看的話，宇宙正將高頻率的能量一波又一波地送入地球，明年開始會是加強版的，當然我寫這些並不是要製造大家的恐慌、焦慮什麼的，我只想跟大家說，我們可以利用這股能量來展開我們全新的人生，利用這股能量來療癒過去的自己，不管你過去曾經是什麼人、遭遇到什麼樣的創傷，宇宙現在給了我們一個機會讓我們去療癒它，接納它，因它本就是屬於我們的一部分，可以透過這股能量好好地檢視過去的自己，然後好好地跟過去的自己說再見，說再見不代表曾經的你不存在，不，祂還存在，存在時空中，只不過我們蛻變了，變成了2.0版本的自己，就像一隻毛毛蟲蛻變成蝴蝶一樣，我們要好好地感謝過去的自己，感謝自己的不完美、感謝過去的自己犯過錯，感謝宇宙給了我這個經驗、感謝宇宙讓我知道了真相，一切都是體驗，一切都是祝福，我們要看向未來，從過去的錯誤中學習、體悟，然後不再重蹈覆轍，這正是我想說的。\n希望我們可以一起加油，在時代的洪流中，突破舒適區，邁向更好的未來。\n","permalink":"https://ellielife.github.io/blog/2024%E5%B9%B4/2023.12.27%E7%99%82%E7%99%92%E6%97%A5%E8%A8%982024%E5%B9%B4%E8%88%87%E9%81%8E%E5%8E%BB%E7%9A%84%E8%87%AA%E5%B7%B1%E8%AA%AA%E5%86%8D%E8%A6%8B/","tags":null,"title":"2024年，與過去的自己說再見。"},{"categories":["Development"],"contents":"The

It is an extremely lightweight engine that provides a very small amount of logic. In our experience that it is just the right amount of logic to be able to create a good static website. If you have used other template systems from different languages or frameworks you will find a lot of similarities in Go templates.\nThis document is a brief primer on using Go templates. The Go docs provide more details.\nIntroduction to Go Templates Go templates provide an extremely simple template language. It adheres to the belief that only the most basic of logic belongs in the template or view layer. One consequence of this simplicity is that Go templates parse very quickly.\nA unique characteristic of Go templates is they are content aware. Variables and content will be sanitized depending on the context of where they are used. More details can be found in the Go docs.\nBasic Syntax Golang templates are HTML files with the addition of variables and functions.\nGo variables and functions are accessible within {{ }}\nAccessing a predefined variable \u0026ldquo;foo\u0026rdquo;:\n{{ foo }} Parameters are separated using spaces\nCalling the add function with input of 1, 2:\n{{ add 1 2 }} Methods and fields are accessed via dot notation\nAccessing the Page Parameter \u0026ldquo;bar\u0026rdquo;\n{{ .Params.bar }} Parentheses can be used to group items together\n{{ if or (isset .Params \u0026quot;alt\u0026quot;) (isset .Params \u0026quot;caption\u0026quot;) }} Caption {{ end }} Variables Each Go template has a struct (object) made available to it. In hugo each template is passed either a page or a node struct depending on which type of page you are rendering. More details are available on the variables page.\nA variable is accessed by referencing the variable name.\n\u0026lt;title\u0026gt;{{ .Title }}\u0026lt;/title\u0026gt; Variables can also be defined and referenced.\n{{ $address := \u0026quot;123 Main St.\u0026quot;}} {{ $address }} Functions Go template ship with a few functions which provide basic functionality. The Go template system also provides a mechanism for applications to extend the available functions with their own. Hugo template functions provide some additional functionality we believe are useful for building websites. Functions are called by using their name followed by the required parameters separated by spaces. Template functions cannot be added without recompiling hugo.\nExample:\n{{ add 1 2 }} Includes When including another template you will pass to it the data it will be able to access. To pass along the current context please remember to include a trailing dot. The templates location will always be starting at the /layout/ directory within Hugo.\nExample:\n{{ template \u0026quot;chrome/header.html\u0026quot; . }} Logic Go templates provide the most basic iteration and conditional logic.\nIteration Just like in Go, the Go templates make heavy use of range to iterate over a map, array or slice. The following are different examples of how to use range.\nExample 1: Using Context\n{{ range array }} {{ . }} {{ end }} Example 2: Declaring value variable name\n{{range $element := array}} {{ $element }} {{ end }} Example 2: Declaring key and value variable name\n{{range $index, $element := array}} {{ $index }} {{ $element }} {{ end }} Conditionals If, else, with, or, \u0026amp; and provide the framework for handling conditional logic in Go Templates. Like range, each statement is closed with end.\nGo Templates treat the following values as false:\nfalse 0 any array, slice, map, or string of length zero Example 1: If\n{{ if isset .Params \u0026quot;title\u0026quot; }}\u0026lt;h4\u0026gt;{{ index .Params \u0026quot;title\u0026quot; }}\u0026lt;/h4\u0026gt;{{ end }} Example 2: If -\u0026gt; Else\n{{ if isset .Params \u0026quot;alt\u0026quot; }} {{ index .Params \u0026quot;alt\u0026quot; }} {{else}} {{ index .Params \u0026quot;caption\u0026quot; }} {{ end }} Example 3: And \u0026amp; Or\n{{ if and (or (isset .Params \u0026quot;title\u0026quot;) (isset .Params \u0026quot;caption\u0026quot;)) (isset .Params \u0026quot;attr\u0026quot;)}} Example 4: With\nAn alternative way of writing \u0026ldquo;if\u0026rdquo; and then referencing the same value is to use \u0026ldquo;with\u0026rdquo; instead. With rebinds the context . within its scope, and skips the block if the variable is absent.\nThe first example above could be simplified as:\n{{ with .Params.title }}\u0026lt;h4\u0026gt;{{ . }}\u0026lt;/h4\u0026gt;{{ end }} Example 5: If -\u0026gt; Else If\n{{ if isset .Params \u0026quot;alt\u0026quot; }} {{ index .Params \u0026quot;alt\u0026quot; }} {{ else if isset .Params \u0026quot;caption\u0026quot; }} {{ index .Params \u0026quot;caption\u0026quot; }} {{ end }} Pipes One of the most powerful components of Go templates is the ability to stack actions one after another. This is done by using pipes. Borrowed from unix pipes, the concept is simple, each pipeline\u0026rsquo;s output becomes the input of the following pipe.\nBecause of the very simple syntax of Go templates, the pipe is essential to being able to chain together function calls. One limitation of the pipes is that they only can work with a single value and that value becomes the last parameter of the next pipeline.\nA few simple examples should help convey how to use the pipe.\nExample 1 :\n{{ if eq 1 1 }} Same {{ end }} is the same as\n{{ eq 1 1 | if }} Same {{ end }} It does look odd to place the if at the end, but it does provide a good illustration of how to use the pipes.\nExample 2 :\n{{ index .Params \u0026quot;disqus_url\u0026quot; | html }} Access the page parameter called \u0026ldquo;disqus_url\u0026rdquo; and escape the HTML.\nExample 3 :\n{{ if or (or (isset .Params \u0026quot;title\u0026quot;) (isset .Params \u0026quot;caption\u0026quot;)) (isset .Params \u0026quot;attr\u0026quot;)}} Stuff Here {{ end }} Could be rewritten as\n{{ isset .Params \u0026quot;caption\u0026quot; | or isset .Params \u0026quot;title\u0026quot; | or isset .Params \u0026quot;attr\u0026quot; | if }} Stuff Here {{ end }} Context (aka. the dot) The most easily overlooked concept to understand about Go templates is that {{ . }} always refers to the current context. In the top level of your template this will be the data set made available to it. Inside of a iteration it will have the value of the current item. When inside of a loop the context has changed. . will no longer refer to the data available to the entire page. If you need to access this from within the loop you will likely want to set it to a variable instead of depending on the context.\nExample:\n{{ $title := .Site.Title }} {{ range .Params.tags }} \u0026lt;li\u0026gt; \u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;{{ $baseurl }}/tags/{{ . | urlize }}\u0026quot;\u0026gt;{{ . }}\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; - {{ $title }} \u0026lt;/li\u0026gt; {{ end }} Notice how once we have entered the loop the value of {{ . }} has changed. We have defined a variable outside of the loop so we have access to it from within the loop.\nHugo Parameters Hugo provides the option of passing values to the template language through the site configuration (for sitewide values), or through the meta data of each specific piece of content. You can define any values of any type (supported by your front matter/config format) and use them however you want to inside of your templates.\nUsing Content (page) Parameters In each piece of content you can provide variables to be used by the templates. This happens in the front matter.\nAn example of this is used in this documentation site. Most of the pages benefit from having the table of contents provided. Sometimes the TOC just doesn\u0026rsquo;t make a lot of sense. We\u0026rsquo;ve defined a variable in our front matter of some pages to turn off the TOC from being displayed.\nHere is the example front matter:\n--- title: \u0026#34;Permalinks\u0026#34; date: \u0026#34;2013-11-18\u0026#34; aliases: - \u0026#34;/doc/permalinks/\u0026#34; groups: [\u0026#34;extras\u0026#34;] groups_weight: 30 notoc: true --- Here is the corresponding code inside of the template:\n{{ if not .Params.notoc }} \u0026lt;div id=\u0026quot;toc\u0026quot; class=\u0026quot;well col-md-4 col-sm-6\u0026quot;\u0026gt; {{ .TableOfContents }} \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; {{ end }} Using Site (config) Parameters In your top-level configuration file (eg, config.yaml) you can define site parameters, which are values which will be available to you in chrome.\nFor instance, you might declare:\nparams: CopyrightHTML: \u0026#34;Copyright \u0026amp;#xA9; 2013 John Doe. All Rights Reserved.\u0026#34; TwitterUser: \u0026#34;spf13\u0026#34; SidebarRecentLimit: 5 Within a footer layout, you might then declare a \u0026lt;footer\u0026gt; which is only provided if the CopyrightHTML parameter is provided, and if it is given, you would declare it to be HTML-safe, so that the HTML entity is not escaped again. This would let you easily update just your top-level config file each January 1st, instead of hunting through your templates.\n{{if .Site.Params.CopyrightHTML}}\u0026lt;footer\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div class=\u0026#34;text-center\u0026#34;\u0026gt;{{.Site.Params.CopyrightHTML | safeHtml}}\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/footer\u0026gt;{{end}} An alternative way of writing the \u0026ldquo;if\u0026rdquo; and then referencing the same value is to use \u0026ldquo;with\u0026rdquo; instead. With rebinds the context . within its scope, and skips the block if the variable is absent:\n{{with .Site.Params.TwitterUser}}\u0026lt;span class=\u0026#34;twitter\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;https://twitter.com/{{.}}\u0026#34; rel=\u0026#34;author\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;img src=\u0026#34;/images/twitter.png\u0026#34; width=\u0026#34;48\u0026#34; height=\u0026#34;48\u0026#34; title=\u0026#34;Twitter: {{.}}\u0026#34; alt=\u0026#34;Twitter\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;{{end}} Finally, if you want to pull \u0026ldquo;magic constants\u0026rdquo; out of your layouts, you can do so, such as in this example:\n\u0026lt;nav class=\u0026#34;recent\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;Recent Posts\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;ul\u0026gt;{{range first .Site.Params.SidebarRecentLimit .Site.Recent}} \u0026lt;li\u0026gt;\u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;{{.RelPermalink}}\u0026#34;\u0026gt;{{.Title}}\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt; {{end}}\u0026lt;/ul\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/nav\u0026gt; ","permalink":"https://ellielife.github.io/post/hugo-template-primer/","tags":["go","golang","templates","themes","development"],"title":"(Hu)go Template Primer"},{"categories":["Development","golang"],"contents":"Step 1.
