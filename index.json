[{"categories":null,"contents":"Welcome to the Mainroad theme documentation. This quick start guide covers Mainroad theme installation and minimal configuration and is intended for intermediate to advanced users. To understand this guide, you need to be familiar with the Hugo static site generator.\nInstallation Before installing the Mainroad theme, make sure that you\u0026rsquo;ve installed Hugo (version 0.54.0 or later) and created a new site. To learn how to install Hugo, visit Hugo Documentation.\nThere are a few ways to install a theme in Hugo. This can be done via git submodule, git clone, Hugo modules, or by downloading the archive and manually copying the files. Three installation options are described below.\nOption A: git submodule Additional requirements: git\nIf you don\u0026rsquo;t plan to make significant changes to the theme but still want to track and update it, you can add it as a git submodule by running the following command from the root directory of your Hugo site:\ngit submodule add https://github.com/vimux/mainroad.git themes/mainroad Note: Netlify expects git submodule instead of git clone.\nOption B: git clone Additional requirements: git\nRun this git clone command from the root of your Hugo site:\ngit clone https://github.com/vimux/mainroad.git themes/mainroad Option C: Manual install If you do not want to use git, you can manually download ZIP and extract it into the themes/mainroad within your Hugo site.\nActivate theme Whichever installation option you choose, don\u0026rsquo;t forget to edit theme param of the site configuration config.toml:\ntheme = \u0026#34;mainroad\u0026#34; To check it out, build the site via hugo command or make it available on a local server via hugo server.\nMinimal configuration Do not copy the example config as-is. Use only the parameters that you need. The Mainroad theme contains required defaults, so you don\u0026rsquo;t need to add all of the configuration parameters to run the theme for the first time. Before adding any theme-specific parameters, make sure to edit the theme param inside the config file and check that the theme works.\nFor information about common customization settings, see Customization page. To view our example configuration, visit demo config.\nEdit this page on GitHub\n","permalink":"https://ellielife.github.io/docs/getting-started/","tags":["Installation"],"title":"Getting started"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Customization page describes common Mainroad configuration parameters which can be specified via configuration file or via Front Matter section. That includes logo section tuning, adding a sidebar with widgets, adjusting highlight color, and more.\nThis section will mainly cover customization settings that are unique to this theme. If something is not covered here, there\u0026rsquo;s a good chance it is covered somewhere in Hugo docs.\nLogo Mainroad allows you to set a custom logo in the site header. You may use text, or image, or both. Use the following options in your site config:\n[Params.logo] image = \u0026#34;img/placeholder.png\u0026#34; title = \u0026#34;Mainroad\u0026#34; subtitle = \u0026#34;Just another site\u0026#34; Note: logo image will display at a maximum width of 128 pixels and a maximum height of 128 pixels when you use text and image simultaneously. When the only logo image is active, it will display at a maximum height of 256 pixels. Ideally, your logo image should be SVG.\nIf you don\u0026rsquo;t set any of these variables, the theme uses the site title as a logo title. Don\u0026rsquo;t need a logo section? Disable it this way:\n[Params.logo] image = false title = false subtitle = false Highlight color Mainroad uses #e22d30 as a default highlight color, but you may choose and set any other color.\n[Params.style.vars] highlightColor = \u0026#34;#e22d30\u0026#34; Post meta Post meta is a feature that refers to including additional meta information (such as author name, categories, date, translations, etc.) on pages. It can be enabled via config using the post_meta key with a list of meta field names as value. Order matters here: rearrange fields if you want to.\n[Params] post_meta = [\u0026#34;author\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;date\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;categories\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;translations\u0026#34;] Full list of available default post meta fields:\nauthor, categories, date, translations In addition to the default meta fields, you can add your own by placing a custom partial under layouts/partials/post_meta/\u0026lt;name\u0026gt;.html.\nPost meta: date localization With Hugo v0.87.0 (or later), date meta field shows localized dates (with weekdays and months in the current language) by default. In most cases, such a transition is painless, but owners of multilingual sites should be careful and check that everything translates as expected after the upgrade.\nYou can also use a predefined layout, like :date_full, and it will output localized dates or times. For additional information about localized dates and possible date/time formatting layouts, please see Hugo: time.Format.\nThumbnail visibility By default, a thumbnail image has shown for a list and single pages simultaneously. In some cases, you may want to show a thumbnail for list-like pages only and hide it on single pages (or vice versa). Control global thumbnail visibility via config, use the key visibility with combination of valid values \u0026quot;list\u0026quot; and \u0026quot;post\u0026quot;.\n[Params.thumbnail] # Show thumbnail only for list items visibility = [\u0026#34;list\u0026#34;] Besides global configuration, you can change thumbnail visibility individually with extended thumbnail notation via front matter block.\nthumbnail: src: \u0026#34;img/placeholder.png\u0026#34; visibility: - list - post This page is an example of list-only thumbnail visibility.\nSidebar Mainroad comes with a configurable sidebar that can be on the left, on the right, or disabled. The default layout can be specified in the [Params.sidebar] section of the configuration. The position can be specified for home, list and single pages individually. Use the keys home, list and single with values \u0026quot;left\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;right\u0026quot; or false.\n[Params.sidebar] home = \u0026#34;right\u0026#34; list = \u0026#34;right\u0026#34; single = \u0026#34;right\u0026#34; The layout can be configured per page, by setting the sidebar parameter with one of the same values (\u0026quot;left\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;right\u0026quot; or false) in the page\u0026rsquo;s front matter.\nsidebar: \u0026#34;left\u0026#34; # Enable sidebar (on the left side) per page The sidebar consists of multiple widgets. Widgets can be enabled individually using the widgets key with a list of widget names as value. You can add your own widgets, by placing a template under layouts/partials/widgets/\u0026lt;name\u0026gt;.html.\n[Params.sidebar] # Enable widgets in given order widgets = [\u0026#34;search\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;recent\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;categories\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;taglist\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;social\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;languages\u0026#34;] The list of widgets can be overwritten from a page\u0026rsquo;s front matter.\n# Enable sidebar widgets in given order widgets: - \u0026#34;search\u0026#34; - \u0026#34;recent\u0026#34; - \u0026#34;taglist\u0026#34; Full list of available default widgets:\nsearch, ddg-search, recent, categories, taglist, social, languages Note: DuckDuckGo widget (ddg-search) deprecated in favor of search widget.\nSome of our widgets respect optional configuration. Have a look at the [Params.widgets] and [Params.widgets.social] sections in the example below.\n[Params.widgets] recent_num = 5 # Set the number of articles in the \u0026#34;Recent articles\u0026#34; widget categories_counter = false # Enable counter for each category in \u0026#34;Categories\u0026#34; widget tags_counter = false # Enable counter for each tag in \u0026#34;Tags\u0026#34; widget [Params.widgets.social] # Enable parts of social widget facebook = \u0026#34;username\u0026#34; twitter = \u0026#34;username\u0026#34; instagram = \u0026#34;username\u0026#34; linkedin = \u0026#34;username\u0026#34; telegram = \u0026#34;username\u0026#34; github = \u0026#34;username\u0026#34; gitlab = \u0026#34;username\u0026#34; bitbucket = \u0026#34;username\u0026#34; email = \u0026#34;example@example.com\u0026#34; Widget caching Sidebar strongly affects overall build time, especially if you are using all of our widgets or even more. Widget caching can significantly improve the generation time. Cached partials remain the same for all affected pages and are not generated multiple times by Hugo. All built-in widgets (search, recent, categories, taglist, social, languages) support caching.\nAdd cached = true inside the corresponding widget\u0026rsquo;s dictionary table to activate caching. For example, to cache the recent widget:\n[Params.widgets.recent] cached = true The following sample configuration extract shows how to cache all standard widgets and generate your website faster:\n[Params.widgets.search] cached = true [Params.widgets.recent] cached = true [Params.widgets.categories] cached = true [Params.widgets.taglist] cached = true [Params.widgets.social] cached = true [Params.widgets.languages] cached = true Not all widgets are cacheable. If a widget contains (can contain) different data for different pages (e.g., for TOC generation), then it should not be cached. Always check that your modified/customized widget is cached correctly.\nSocial Widget: custom links Mainroad contains built-in social links in the social widget. In addition to default social links, you may set custom links by adding Params.widgets.social.custom to your config.toml. Here is an example:\n[[Params.widgets.social.custom]] title = \u0026#34;My Home Page\u0026#34; url = \u0026#34;https://example.com\u0026#34; If you want to display an icon of your social link, you need to put SVG icon file in layouts/partials directory under your site\u0026rsquo;s root. The icon key filed, which is optional, should be a path relative to layouts/partials.\n[[Params.widgets.social.custom]] title = \u0026#34;Youtube\u0026#34; url = \u0026#34;https://youtube.com/user/username\u0026#34; icon = \u0026#34;youtube.svg\u0026#34; Note: Only SVG files are supported to be used as custom social icons. If you use any other files, PNG for example, a compile error will be raised by Hugo. Moreover, not every SVG icon can be used. For better results, it should be one-color SVG file with a special class attribute {{ with .class }}{{ . }} {{ end }} and 24x24 size. At a minimum, custom SVG icon needs these attributes:\n\u0026lt;svg class=\u0026#34;{{ with .class }}{{ . }} {{ end }} icon\u0026#34; width=\u0026#34;24\u0026#34; height=\u0026#34;24\u0026#34;\u0026gt;...\u0026lt;/svg\u0026gt; You can also specify the rel attribute for the link. By default, the attribute value is \u0026quot;noopener noreferrer\u0026quot;. You can remove the attribute completely by setting its value to false.\n[[Params.widgets.social.custom]] title = \u0026#34;My Home Page\u0026#34; url = \u0026#34;https://example.com\u0026#34; rel = \u0026#34;me\u0026#34; [[Params.widgets.social.custom]] title = \u0026#34;Youtube\u0026#34; url = \u0026#34;https://youtube.com/user/username\u0026#34; rel = false Search box widget The search box widget can refer to the results of Google, Bing, and DuckDuckGo searches. By default, Mainroad uses Google search if no additional configuration options are specified.\nTo use a different search engine, first of all, check that the search widget is enabled. Then set the search parameters (Site.Params.widgets.search section) according to the data below.\nGoogle (default):\n[Params.widgets.search] url = \u0026#34;https://google.com/search\u0026#34; [Params.widgets.search.input] name = \u0026#34;sitesearch\u0026#34; pre = \u0026#34;\u0026#34; DuckDuckGo:\n[Params.widgets.search] url = \u0026#34;https://duckduckgo.com/\u0026#34; [Params.widgets.search.input] name = \u0026#34;sites\u0026#34; pre = \u0026#34;\u0026#34; Bing:\n[Params.widgets.search] url = \u0026#34;https://www.bing.com/search\u0026#34; [Params.widgets.search.input] name = \u0026#34;q1\u0026#34; pre = \u0026#34;site:\u0026#34; Google PSE:\n[Params.widgets.search] url = \u0026#34;/search/\u0026#34; [Params.widgets.search.input] name = false pre = \u0026#34;\u0026#34; Note that Google PSE requires additional steps to work correctly. See Creating a Programmable Search Engine and especially our FAQ for more instructions.\nMenus Mainroad supports multiple menus. The main menu is fully responsive and displayed right under the site header. The secondary menus side and footer are displayed in a sidebar widget and the page footer respectively. To add a page to a menu, add a menu: \u0026lt;menu\u0026gt; parameter to the page\u0026rsquo;s front matter:\nmenu: main # Add page to a main menu Note: Don\u0026rsquo;t forget to enable the sidemenu widget in the widgets configuration param if you want to use the side menu.\nYou can also add a page to multiple menus by providing a list:\n# Add page to a main, side, and footer menu menu: - main - side - footer Note: Please keep in mind that Mainroad menus don\u0026rsquo;t support nested items i.e. submenus.\nSee Menus from official Hugo documentation for more info.\nCustom Google Fonts support Mainroad uses Open Sans from Google Fonts as a main font. But you can use any other font from Google Fonts if you\u0026rsquo;d like. Beware, in most cases, such changes require manual CSS adjustment because every set of fonts is different and might not look as good as our default font.\nFollow the procedure below.\nOpen Google Fonts, choose font(s) that you prefer and copy href font link. For this particular example, we choose Roboto with 3 different styles. Our href font link:\nhttps://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Roboto:ital,wght@0,400;0,700;1,400\u0026amp;display=swap Set googleFontsLink site\u0026rsquo;s config param value to your href font link. For example:\n[Params] googleFontsLink = \u0026#34;https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Roboto:ital,wght@0,400;0,700;1,400\u0026amp;display=swap\u0026#34; Override default font-family set(s):\n[Params.style.vars] fontFamilyPrimary = \u0026#34;\u0026#39;Roboto\u0026#39;, sans-serif\u0026#34; It is possible to disable Google Fonts and use system font stack instead.\nDisable Google Fonts include. Set googleFontsLink site\u0026rsquo;s config param value to false:\n[Params] googleFontsLink = false Override font-family sets:\n[Params.style.vars] # Override font-family sets. Take care of different quotes OR escaping symbols in these params if necessary fontFamilyPrimary = \u0026#34;system-ui, -apple-system, \u0026#39;Segoe UI\u0026#39;, Roboto, \u0026#39;Helvetica Neue\u0026#39;, Arial, \u0026#39;Noto Sans\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Liberation Sans\u0026#39;, sans-serif, \u0026#39;Apple Color Emoji\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Segoe UI Emoji\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Segoe UI Symbol\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Noto Color Emoji\u0026#39;\u0026#34; # Secondary font-family set responsible for pre, code, kbd, and samp tags font fontFamilySecondary = \u0026#34;SFMono-Regular, Menlo, Monaco, Consolas, \u0026#39;Liberation Mono\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Courier New\u0026#39;, monospace\u0026#34; Edit this page on GitHub\n","permalink":"https://ellielife.github.io/docs/customization/","tags":null,"title":"Customization"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Browse this FAQ page to find answers to frequently asked questions that have not been covered elsewhere in the documentation.\nThe answers have been categorized into two groups:\nAnswers to general questions without any lines of code. Answers to technical questions with code snippets, step-by-step instructions, etc. General questions Do I need to have prior experience before proceeding with the Mainroad theme? Yes. You\u0026rsquo;ll need to be familiar with Hugo before proceeding. Our docs section is intended for intermediate to advanced users and developers. Our documentation may still be helpful to users with minimal experience, but are not comprehensive.\nDo I need to use the extended version of Hugo? No. Mainroad theme intentionally does not use any features of the extended version. As such, the extended version of Hugo is not required (but applicable).\nIs there a list of all possible configuration options? Configuration:\nSee All Configuration Settings for the full list of Hugo-defined variables with their default values. See Mainroad config.toml example for the full list of Mainroad-specific variables. Front Matter:\nSee Front Matter Variables for the list of Hugo-defined Front Matter variables. See Mainroad Front Matter example for the list of Mainroad-specific Front Matter variables. What if I have more questions? Should I create an issue? We don\u0026rsquo;t provide personal technical support. As stated in our contributing guidelines, please do not use the issue tracker for personal support. This includes reports like: “How do I do this\u0026quot;, “Everything is broken; help me”, “I changed something, and it doesn\u0026rsquo;t work anymore”, “It\u0026rsquo;s not a personal issue, but I just want to ask how X or Y works”, “I forked your theme, then something broke; fix this immediately”, and so on.\nThe issue tracker should only be used for bug reports, feature requests, and discussions that comply with our contributing rules. All other issues will be closed and marked as invalid.\nTechnical questions I want to get the favicon.ico and apple-touch-icon.png to match my hightlightColor. What should I do? There is no way to do this on the fly with Hugo, but you can use the one-liners below with some preparations:\nCopy: ./themes/mainroad/static/favicon.ico to ./static/favicon.ico ./themes/mainroad/static/apple-touch-icon.png to ./static/apple-touch-icon.png At the beginning of each script, replace the color in the variable with your preferred color. You must use six-digit hex triplet notation (e.g., #E22D30) to make it work properly. Go to the root of your project directory in the terminal and execute these two commands accordingly.\na=#E22D30;a=\\\\x${a:5:2}\\\\x${a:3:2}\\\\x${a:1:2};for i in 98 274 578;do printf $a|dd of=static/favicon.ico bs=1 seek=$i conv=notrunc;done a=#E22D30;a=$(echo 504C54452A2A2A${a:1:6}|sed -e \u0026#39;s/../\\\\x\u0026amp;/g\u0026#39;);printf $a|gzip|tail -c8|od -tx4 -N4 -An|xargs|sed -e \u0026#39;s/../\\\\x\u0026amp;/g\u0026#39;|printf $a$(cat -)|dd of=static/apple-touch-icon.png bs=1 seek=37 conv=notrunc I want to use Google Programmable Search Engine as a site search engine. Is it possible? Yes, it is possible to use Google PSE (CSE) as a site search engine.\nCreate a new search engine with Google PSE. Google account required.\nAdd a new layout.\nCreate file ./layouts/search/index.html with the following content:\n{{ define \u0026#34;main\u0026#34; }} \u0026lt;script async src=\u0026#34;https://cse.google.com/cse.js?cx=YOUR_PSE_ENGINE_ID\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div class=\u0026#34;gcse-search\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; {{ end }} Don\u0026rsquo;t forget to paste your Google PSE ID.\nAdd search page by creating file ./content/search.md with the following content:\n--- title: Search authorbox: false sidebar: false pager: false --- Optional. If you use the search widget, don\u0026rsquo;t forget to change the search box parameters:\n[Params.widgets.search] url = \u0026#34;/search/\u0026#34; input.name = false input.pre = \u0026#34;\u0026#34; Google PSE (CSE) should work when it\u0026rsquo;s done.

主要是因為對岸的小習把收復台灣視為他任內要達成的目標之一，期限在2027年內，算一算時間也快到了，剩不到兩年的時間，小習若要在任內做出很大的成績留名青史，就要拿下台灣，這是原因之一，第二個原因是中共身為大國，豈能容許自家的海上領地被限縮在一定範圍內，當然勢必得要將台灣納入領土內，這樣他們就能取得部分太平洋的控制權，也能間接地得到亞太地區的領導權，這會導致原本是美國同盟國的國家倒戈轉向中國，例如:日本、南韓、菲律賓等\u0026hellip;，很遺憾地是命運不是站在中共這邊的，因為歷史性的革命人物橫空出世了，那就是美國川普又出來跟大家Say hello，哈哈😆\n老實說，雖然有些人很不認同川普，但不得不承認的是還好是川普當選總統，因為也只有川普能把拿到死神牌的美國做活，他現在正在做的事情或許全世界的人都不能認同，但他這樣做都是有原因的，就拿關稅來說吧，川普是個成功的企業家，他擁有自己的商業帝國，怎麼會不明白關稅這招是有風險的，他知道他明白他不是一個傻子，大家都戲稱他為\u0026quot;狂人\u0026quot;，但他其實是個有智慧的狂人，沒有表面上那麼膚淺，另外，川普有一點讓我很欣賞，那就是\u0026quot;他決不會輕易地讓別人看出他背後真正的意圖\u0026quot;，這是我在他身上看到的優點之一，我覺得這是身經百戰的商人才會有的特質，那就是\u0026quot;不到最後，才會亮出自己真正的底牌\u0026quot;，你看看我們全世界都還要試著推敲他這麼做的動機是什麼呢😆\n我們要如何提早做準備? 因為不知道什麼時候會發生，最好抱著隨時會發生的警覺性。 先上網調查家裡附近還有公司附近的防空避難在哪裡，以防萬一發生了可以知道要去哪裡躲避比較安全，你甚至可以是帶領大家躲避的人。 平時可以多看野外求生的影片，看看這些大佬們在野外是如何使用大自然的素材生火、狩獵、野外受傷包紮技術等\u0026hellip;。 平時多準備生存糧食、急救包等\u0026hellip; 至於要怎麼準備比較好可以上網搜尋，會有一推生存達人教你怎麼準備。 最後，現在不要太相信政府和主流媒體的話，甚至是網紅的話，因為有些是被\u0026rsquo;收買\u0026rsquo;的，對任何事情和資訊都要有自己的見解，而不是人家說什麼就是什麼，拿我舉例，你們今天看到的這篇文章是可以抱著懷疑的態度質疑我也可以挑戰我的，為什麼我會這樣說，是因為我們要培養自己對於事實的真相有探究的精神。\n自己的個人見解 本來我覺得機率有點小，但近期發現機率似乎比我想像中的大，為什麼這麼說呢?因為我看到美國將這次的注意力和關注力大幅度地轉向亞太地區，從美國一系列的小動作可以看出，它正悄悄地為亞太戰區做準備，以防萬一真的開戰了也要打贏這場戰，所以我才會覺得台海戰爭會發生的機率比我想像中的還要高，以前我太低估中共要拿下台灣的決心，這邊也要告訴各位，即使經過了2027年後，我們仍要保持警覺，因為拿下台灣是他們勢在必得的目標。\n另外我看到網路上出現很多質疑聲浪，大部分的人都在懷疑台海戰爭真的爆發了，美國川普會不會出兵協防台灣，而大部分人的見解是『不會』，但我個人的見解是『會』，為什麼?從川普的關稅文件就可以看出端倪，上面寫\u0026rsquo;Taiwan\u0026rsquo;，等於承認台灣是個國家而不是中國的一個省份，這動作看似不大但很明顯就是向中共傳達訊息:『你最好不要亂來，因為我是真的會派兵協防台灣。』所以我相信美國是會派兵協防台灣的，甚至會讓大家跌破眼鏡的是日本、南韓、菲律賓也會以美國盟友的身分出手幫忙。\n至於台海戰爭會不會爆發，我相信我們的政府是最清楚的，就像俄烏戰爭開打之前，其實美國是有派賀景麗去烏克蘭協調，但沒有成功，而這件事是在俄烏戰爭開打前的1到3個月吧，我有點忘了，有興趣地可以上網查(抱歉，懶得查，哈哈🙂)。\n幾個月後，當俄羅斯真的進攻烏克蘭時，人民居然是那個最後知道的，那為什麼烏克蘭政府不提早公佈?答案是因為公佈了會影響很多層面，例如經濟層面，試問，如果你在三個月前就知道戰爭會開打，你還會繼續留在這裡嗎?你還會像平常一樣上班嗎?當然是趕緊收拾東西跑去別的國家避難阿，你還會有心情在那邊工作嗎?不只如此，外資企業也會提早做撤資的準備，從這點就可以看出，國家是會為了經濟利益而捨棄人民，而享有利益的會是少數實際掌權的人手上。\n現在台灣的處境其實也很讓人擔憂呢，本來我是不怎麼關注這些的，覺得政治這些的交給那些有理想有抱負的人去做就好了，但\u0026hellip;一直有意無意被提醒偶而也要關注一下自己國家的政治，所以只要是送到我眼前的新聞政治我都會看一下，看了之後才發現原來我是真的要關心台灣的政治還有世界的局勢呢，好啦，這個我後面再出一篇文章是有關於現在台灣的處境，不想寫太多呢😅\n話說回來，因沒人會知道台海戰爭會不會發生，但近期確實有蠻多警覺意識的人離開台灣，至於要不要繼續留在台灣就看個人的選擇囉！我的話還是會留在台灣，畢竟這裡就是我的家園，我的祖先們千萬年前就開始守護這片土地，這片土地繼承了我們原住民世世代代的傳承，中間也不知道跟多少的外族勢力對抗，我們身上流著的血液是願意為了守護家園而戰的，是不會輕易退縮的，要死也要光榮地戰死，死了就算了吧，大不了重來一次，我的靈魂又不是沒做過這種事。\n那些剩下來的人\u0026hellip;\n不要以為你們沒有任務做啊，因為接下來要面臨的是會是一系列的考驗，地球等著你們去拯救呢😊\n禱文\n親愛的守護台灣這片土地的守護靈們，\n親愛的歷代台灣祖先們，\n還有守護在台海周圍的海神/神獸們，\n我知道祢們很強大，\n如今台灣面臨戰爭的風險，\n願祢們能保佑台灣度過這次的難關，\n祝福台灣平平安安、繁榮昌盛，萬古長青棗鉛。\n","permalink":"https://ellielife.github.io/blog/2025%E5%B9%B4/2025.04.04.%E6%99%82%E4%BA%8B%E8%A9%95%E8%AB%96%E6%8F%90%E9%86%92%E6%AF%94%E8%B5%B7%E9%97%9C%E7%A8%85%E6%88%91%E6%AF%94%E8%BC%83%E5%9C%A8%E6%84%8F%E5%8F%B0%E6%B5%B7%E6%88%B0%E7%88%AD%E5%9B%A0%E7%82%BA%E6%88%B0%E7%88%AD%E9%A2%A8%E9%9A%AA%E6%98%AF%E5%AD%98%E5%9C%A8%E7%9A%84/","tags":null,"title":"【提醒】比起關稅，我比較在意台海戰爭，因為戰爭風險是存在的!"},{"categories":["生活日誌"],"contents":"2025年的關鍵字是在破壞中重生，也就是說明年會是大家破斧成舟的一年，這股蛻變能量是加強版的，又快又猛，不趕快處理的話，可能又會有新的事件發生囉！所以我們要跟上這一波快速蛻變能量的話，我們必須要將專注力關注在自己身上，而不是在外在。\n為什麼?因為明年宇宙爸爸會藉由這股能量引領我們活出最高的生命品質，它會推動你去做一些改變來支持你活出最高善的自己，換句話說，我們都會被迫跳出舒適圈，但前提是我們要願意給老天帶領，願意面對自己生命的課題，從中學習並遵循你內心的聲音去經歷這些改變。\n但反過來，如果我們持續逃避、持續失控，死不聆聽自己的內心，不跟任何人合作、不跟老天合作、不尊重自己的感受，用盡你自己所有的能量在抗拒改變、不願意學習跟鍛鍊，那今年你就會過的很辛苦。\n同時，要有心理準備，因為這股能量也會慢慢的淘汰掉那些不再適合我們的人事物，因為它們已不能再支持我們成為更高版本的自己，已不能再支持我們活出最高善的自己，靈魂的本質是改變，所以靈魂會一直成長下去，要意識到天下沒有無不散的宴席，即使你沒有準備好，但時間到了，還是得去面對這不捨和傷心的心情，但往好的地方想，在未來的某天再遇見時，雙方的靈魂水平是平等的/相似的，又可以成為朋友或是伴侶來共同成長、共創美好的生命記憶。\n生活虐我千百遍，我待生活如初戀 祝福大家也祝福自己，在2025年給自己勇氣和自信去主動迎接挑戰和改變，不要等命運來推動，也不要等命運來審判，因為命運並不總是引導我們至正確的方向，要意識到我們是自己生命的創造者和體驗者，我們的生命故事應由我們自己撰寫，而不是宇宙為你計畫的預設版本。我們要利用這一波蛻變能量為自己爭取更多成長的機會，讓生活協助我們鍛鍊很多美好的品質。\n今年還是會有很多大大小小的社會和國際動盪，但我會希望各位將關注力放在自己身上，例如有沒有好好的愛自己，去為自己做點事，例如可以關注自己的身體健不健康，吃什麼食物會引起身體的不適反應等等，另外也要好好的去關注自己的情緒，因為現在地球的能量非常不穩定，我們身處其中自然也會被影響到，也要小心身邊的人會有情緒爆發的時候，我們能做的就是承接這個人的內在情緒(量力而為)，用同理心去理解身邊的人，然後給予他們愛和關心，但如果你平時不是個情緒穩定的人，可以多多去運動、靜心或是多去做自己熱愛的事情，唯有當我們穩定自己自身時，就已經在幫助地球平衡能量了，要學習成為颱風眼，當大家在經歷個人暴風雨時，你可以適時地給他們溫暖和幫助（這也是在幫助地球穩定能量），同時也不要害怕去經歷這些暴風雨，因為它們都是靈魂進化的好糧食，讓愛與智慧成為你的翅膀，在狂風暴雨中不費力地穿梭翱翔😂，請記住，當你覺得孤單的時候，要意識到你不是一個人在經歷這些，我們有一群夥伴正一起逆風而行，當你抵達終點站時你會看見真正的同伴。（我好像講遠了，哈哈！但沒關係！）\n","permalink":"https://ellielife.github.io/blog/2024%E5%B9%B4/2024.12.25%E7%94%9F%E6%B4%BB%E6%97%A5%E8%AA%8C2025%E5%B9%B4%E5%9C%A8%E7%A0%B4%E5%A3%9E%E4%B8%AD%E9%87%8D%E7%94%9F/","tags":null,"title":"2025年，在破壞中重生。"},{"categories":["生活日誌"],"contents":" 世界上只有一種真正的英雄主義，那就是在認清生活的真相後，依舊熱愛生活。 ── 羅曼.羅蘭\n2025年，川普上任後，經濟不確定性會更加嚴重。 從2023年開始，我們看到一些知名企業正大規模的裁員，明年川普上任後，這個問題只會更加嚴重，你會看到有越來越多的公司企業面臨倒閉或是轉型，因此2025年還是會上演一波大規模的裁員潮，在亞洲的台灣，不要以為不會被影響到，尤其我們又面臨地緣政治這一塊且很可能發生這三次世界大戰，應該有很多的外商公司有移出的打算，所以這只是時間的問題罷了，目前在對岸的中國，首當其衝，正面臨經濟下滑，公司企業外移工廠倒閉，年輕人找不到工作的情況，現在在他們的社群媒體上甚至出現了\u0026quot;新型窮人”這個新的詞彙。\n新型窮人的定義如下: ➡️衣著光鮮亮麗，卻負債累累，生活拮据\n➡️雖然有房子和車子，卻沒有過多的資金可以存款，每個月卻是被負債追著跑。\n➡️個人負債規模還高達上百萬人民幣。\n這不經讓我思考，在過去大多數人對成功的定義，認為有房有車白領的工作是成功人士的重要指標，但隨著科技不斷的發展，過去我們認為的這些成功和幸福指標在未來反而不是年輕人重要的首選，甚至不再成為年輕人對於成功的典範。現在成功的典範對每個人來說都不同，因為每個人所選擇的生活方式不一樣。\n比如我，比起世俗的成功，我比較在意自己是否活的幸福、開心和快樂，即使我沒有擁有很多錢，但至少我活得很自由，我不再為了金錢長時間待在公司或工廠，而是花更多的時間與自己、朋友或是親愛的人相處，花更多的時間去體驗這個世界，金錢對我來說不再是幸福的重要指標，因為年老時，我可以回到自己的家鄉種種菜，養一些小動物之類的，實現自給自足的生活。(如果可以的話，我想養馬，騎著牠在鄉野間奔馳一定很帥！我甚至想帶牠環島，哈哈哈。)\n在我小的時候，我的奶奶和舅舅就是這樣生活的，吃自己種的菜，養豬養雞養鵝養狗狗，甚至還有養牛和擁有兩座小魚池塘，我舅舅是建築工人，所以他會diy自己的房子，然後會拿一些東西與附近鄰居交換所需的物品，基本上大家都很願意交換的，完全不需要用到金錢，而且有時候鄰居也會分享好吃的食物給我們，我們也會，小時候我就明白自己很喜歡這樣的生活，很快樂也很愜意，我就很喜歡奶奶家戶外的大客廳，這裡是家人和附近鄰居感情交流的地方，等於是我們的交誼廳就對了，我也很喜歡奶奶總是在天氣好的時候，拿出一張躺椅，在樹蔭下曬太陽和乘涼，真的很Chill！長大後，我就知道自己的退休生活是長什麼樣的，因為我的奶奶和舅舅為我示範了很好的典範。(順便偷偷告訴你們，不要看我奶奶和舅舅過這樣的生活，其實他們很有錢，有不少的積蓄，但他們還是選擇過這樣簡單樸實的生活，這是他們去世以後我才知道的事情。)\n與其買車買房，被綑綁30-50年之間，不如做資產分配，過有品質的生活 是我的話，我寧願租房子，原因之一是我不太喜歡城市高樓大廈一層又一層的房子，我是鄉下長大的孩子，喜歡透天厝、喜歡庭園、喜歡大自然，所以與其被綑綁30-50年之間，不如過有體面的生活，扣掉年老退休生活基金，我還可以買喜歡的衣服，剪喜歡的頭髮造型，買喜歡的保養品和化妝品，重點是我要吃好一點，畢竟我這一生好珍貴喔！對靈魂而言，每一世的體驗都很珍貴，所以你這一生也很珍貴，要好好珍惜！愛自己的同時不要忘了也要愛身邊的人，與他們創造美好的生命記憶，畢竟這一世過後你不知道在未來還會不會遇到相同的靈魂跟你一起體驗人生呢！\n擁抱不確定，自由職業是未來趨勢 隨著通貨膨脹、物價不斷的上漲，我們每位勞動者承擔的債務在不斷的增加，而且債務增長速度超過了收入的增長。**我們不得不工作更長的時間來還債，可支配的時間變少。**你們能想像現在每一位剛出生的嬰兒，就已經背負好幾代的債務嗎?根據IMF全球政府負債比的報告，日本政府負債佔GDP的比重為245%，美國政府171%，中國佔111%。\n※資料來源 財經M平方\n在全球政府負債佔正每一年增加，在這種情況下，與其跟人一起出去花錢吃喝玩樂，倒不如直接消費互聯網內容，而且在未來人們更願意為互聯網上優質的內容付費更高的價格，畢竟優質的內容現在可是很稀缺的呢！在未來知識付費會是趨勢。\n如果要跳脫這個迴圈，就要擁抱不確定，發展和經營個人品牌，自由職業是未來的趨勢。\n個人自媒體時代的崛起 很多人都認為人人自媒體的時代已經結束，但我個人卻認為現在反而是自媒體崛起的剛開始，在未來，你會看到有越來越多的人會聽從自己內在的聲音去發展個人品牌，否則的話，很難在未來獲得競爭力。而且好工作都是透過介紹來的，不是自己去尋找，所以如果要跳脫這時代經濟不確定性帶來的負面效應，那你就要\u0026quot;趁現在”把握機會去發展自媒體，讓更多的人去認識你，知道你的興趣和愛好，知道你的專業，如果你想要讓大家願意為你的服務支付更高的價格，那你就需要挪有別人不具備的IP，在未來是人人自媒體的時代，會有越來越多的人透過網路去認識你，人們喜歡聽活生生的故事，可以與之互動鮮活的人，這就是為什麼許多大明星在網路直播賣東西時，都要親自跳下來的原因。\n那…我們不一定要成為大明星或者是大網紅，我們只要在自己感興趣和熱愛的領域內深耕發展就好，為自己培養一群忠實的粉絲客戶，反正只要大家有相關業務需求時，至少你是在名單內的，甚至是別人第一優先考量，這樣就好，至少你不會餓死，哈哈哈。\n","permalink":"https://ellielife.github.io/blog/2024%E5%B9%B4/2024.12.15%E7%94%9F%E6%B4%BB%E6%97%A5%E8%AA%8C%E6%93%81%E6%8A%B1%E4%B8%8D%E7%A2%BA%E5%AE%9A%E8%87%AA%E7%94%B1%E8%81%B7%E6%A5%AD%E6%98%AF%E6%9C%AA%E4%BE%86%E7%9A%84%E8%B6%A8%E5%8B%A2/","tags":null,"title":"擁抱不確定，自由職業是未來的趨勢"}]
