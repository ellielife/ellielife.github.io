[{"categories":null,"contents":"Welcome to the Mainroad theme documentation. This quick start guide covers Mainroad theme installation and minimal configuration and is intended for intermediate to advanced users. To understand this guide, you need to be familiar with the Hugo static site generator.\nInstallation Before installing the Mainroad theme, make sure that you\u0026rsquo;ve installed Hugo (version 0.54.0 or later) and created a new site. To learn how to install Hugo, visit Hugo Documentation.\nThere are a few ways to install a theme in Hugo. This can be done via git submodule, git clone, Hugo modules, or by downloading the archive and manually copying the files. Three installation options are described below.\nOption A: git submodule Additional requirements: git\nIf you don\u0026rsquo;t plan to make significant changes to the theme but still want to track and update it, you can add it as a git submodule by running the following command from the root directory of your Hugo site:\ngit submodule add https://github.com/vimux/mainroad.git themes/mainroad Note: Netlify expects git submodule instead of git clone.\nOption B: git clone Additional requirements: git\nRun this git clone command from the root of your Hugo site:\ngit clone https://github.com/vimux/mainroad.git themes/mainroad Option C: Manual install If you do not want to use git, you can manually download ZIP and extract it into the themes/mainroad within your Hugo site.\nActivate theme Whichever installation option you choose, don\u0026rsquo;t forget to edit theme param of the site configuration config.toml:\ntheme = \u0026#34;mainroad\u0026#34; To check it out, build the site via hugo command or make it available on a local server via hugo server.\nMinimal configuration Do not copy the example config as-is. Use only the parameters that you need. The Mainroad theme contains required defaults, so you don\u0026rsquo;t need to add all of the configuration parameters to run the theme for the first time. Before adding any theme-specific parameters, make sure to edit the theme param inside the config file and check that the theme works.\nFor information about common customization settings, see Customization page. To view our example configuration, visit demo config.\nEdit this page on GitHub\n","permalink":"https://ellielife.github.io/docs/getting-started/","tags":["Installation"],"title":"Getting started"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Customization page describes common Mainroad configuration parameters which can be specified via configuration file or via Front Matter section. That includes logo section tuning, adding a sidebar with widgets, adjusting highlight color, and more.\nThis section will mainly cover customization settings that are unique to this theme. If something is not covered here, there\u0026rsquo;s a good chance it is covered somewhere in Hugo docs.\nLogo Mainroad allows you to set a custom logo in the site header. You may use text, or image, or both. Use the following options in your site config:\n[Params.logo] image = \u0026#34;img/placeholder.png\u0026#34; title = \u0026#34;Mainroad\u0026#34; subtitle = \u0026#34;Just another site\u0026#34; Note: logo image will display at a maximum width of 128 pixels and a maximum height of 128 pixels when you use text and image simultaneously. When the only logo image is active, it will display at a maximum height of 256 pixels. Ideally, your logo image should be SVG.\nIf you don\u0026rsquo;t set any of these variables, the theme uses the site title as a logo title. Don\u0026rsquo;t need a logo section? Disable it this way:\n[Params.logo] image = false title = false subtitle = false Highlight color Mainroad uses #e22d30 as a default highlight color, but you may choose and set any other color.\n[Params.style.vars] highlightColor = \u0026#34;#e22d30\u0026#34; Post meta Post meta is a feature that refers to including additional meta information (such as author name, categories, date, translations, etc.) on pages. It can be enabled via config using the post_meta key with a list of meta field names as value. Order matters here: rearrange fields if you want to.\n[Params] post_meta = [\u0026#34;author\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;date\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;categories\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;translations\u0026#34;] Full list of available default post meta fields:\nauthor, categories, date, translations In addition to the default meta fields, you can add your own by placing a custom partial under layouts/partials/post_meta/\u0026lt;name\u0026gt;.html.\nPost meta: date localization With Hugo v0.87.0 (or later), date meta field shows localized dates (with weekdays and months in the current language) by default. In most cases, such a transition is painless, but owners of multilingual sites should be careful and check that everything translates as expected after the upgrade.\nYou can also use a predefined layout, like :date_full, and it will output localized dates or times. For additional information about localized dates and possible date/time formatting layouts, please see Hugo: time.Format.\nThumbnail visibility By default, a thumbnail image has shown for a list and single pages simultaneously. In some cases, you may want to show a thumbnail for list-like pages only and hide it on single pages (or vice versa). Control global thumbnail visibility via config, use the key visibility with combination of valid values \u0026quot;list\u0026quot; and \u0026quot;post\u0026quot;.\n[Params.thumbnail] # Show thumbnail only for list items visibility = [\u0026#34;list\u0026#34;] Besides global configuration, you can change thumbnail visibility individually with extended thumbnail notation via front matter block.\nthumbnail: src: \u0026#34;img/placeholder.png\u0026#34; visibility: - list - post This page is an example of list-only thumbnail visibility.\nSidebar Mainroad comes with a configurable sidebar that can be on the left, on the right, or disabled. The default layout can be specified in the [Params.sidebar] section of the configuration. The position can be specified for home, list and single pages individually. Use the keys home, list and single with values \u0026quot;left\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;right\u0026quot; or false.\n[Params.sidebar] home = \u0026#34;right\u0026#34; list = \u0026#34;right\u0026#34; single = \u0026#34;right\u0026#34; The layout can be configured per page, by setting the sidebar parameter with one of the same values (\u0026quot;left\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;right\u0026quot; or false) in the page\u0026rsquo;s front matter.\nsidebar: \u0026#34;left\u0026#34; # Enable sidebar (on the left side) per page The sidebar consists of multiple widgets. Widgets can be enabled individually using the widgets key with a list of widget names as value. You can add your own widgets, by placing a template under layouts/partials/widgets/\u0026lt;name\u0026gt;.html.\n[Params.sidebar] # Enable widgets in given order widgets = [\u0026#34;search\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;recent\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;categories\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;taglist\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;social\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;languages\u0026#34;] The list of widgets can be overwritten from a page\u0026rsquo;s front matter.\n# Enable sidebar widgets in given order widgets: - \u0026#34;search\u0026#34; - \u0026#34;recent\u0026#34; - \u0026#34;taglist\u0026#34; Full list of available default widgets:\nsearch, ddg-search, recent, categories, taglist, social, languages Note: DuckDuckGo widget (ddg-search) deprecated in favor of search widget.\nSome of our widgets respect optional configuration. Have a look at the [Params.widgets] and [Params.widgets.social] sections in the example below.\n[Params.widgets] recent_num = 5 # Set the number of articles in the \u0026#34;Recent articles\u0026#34; widget categories_counter = false # Enable counter for each category in \u0026#34;Categories\u0026#34; widget tags_counter = false # Enable counter for each tag in \u0026#34;Tags\u0026#34; widget [Params.widgets.social] # Enable parts of social widget facebook = \u0026#34;username\u0026#34; twitter = \u0026#34;username\u0026#34; instagram = \u0026#34;username\u0026#34; linkedin = \u0026#34;username\u0026#34; telegram = \u0026#34;username\u0026#34; github = \u0026#34;username\u0026#34; gitlab = \u0026#34;username\u0026#34; bitbucket = \u0026#34;username\u0026#34; email = \u0026#34;example@example.com\u0026#34; Widget caching Sidebar strongly affects overall build time, especially if you are using all of our widgets or even more. Widget caching can significantly improve the generation time. Cached partials remain the same for all affected pages and are not generated multiple times by Hugo. All built-in widgets (search, recent, categories, taglist, social, languages) support caching.\nAdd cached = true inside the corresponding widget\u0026rsquo;s dictionary table to activate caching. For example, to cache the recent widget:\n[Params.widgets.recent] cached = true The following sample configuration extract shows how to cache all standard widgets and generate your website faster:\n[Params.widgets.search] cached = true [Params.widgets.recent] cached = true [Params.widgets.categories] cached = true [Params.widgets.taglist] cached = true [Params.widgets.social] cached = true [Params.widgets.languages] cached = true Not all widgets are cacheable. If a widget contains (can contain) different data for different pages (e.g., for TOC generation), then it should not be cached. Always check that your modified/customized widget is cached correctly.\nSocial Widget: custom links Mainroad contains built-in social links in the social widget. In addition to default social links, you may set custom links by adding Params.widgets.social.custom to your config.toml. Here is an example:\n[[Params.widgets.social.custom]] title = \u0026#34;My Home Page\u0026#34; url = \u0026#34;https://example.com\u0026#34; If you want to display an icon of your social link, you need to put SVG icon file in layouts/partials directory under your site\u0026rsquo;s root. The icon key filed, which is optional, should be a path relative to layouts/partials.\n[[Params.widgets.social.custom]] title = \u0026#34;Youtube\u0026#34; url = \u0026#34;https://youtube.com/user/username\u0026#34; icon = \u0026#34;youtube.svg\u0026#34; Note: Only SVG files are supported to be used as custom social icons. If you use any other files, PNG for example, a compile error will be raised by Hugo. Moreover, not every SVG icon can be used. For better results, it should be one-color SVG file with a special class attribute {{ with .class }}{{ . }} {{ end }} and 24x24 size. At a minimum, custom SVG icon needs these attributes:\n\u0026lt;svg class=\u0026#34;{{ with .class }}{{ . }} {{ end }} icon\u0026#34; width=\u0026#34;24\u0026#34; height=\u0026#34;24\u0026#34;\u0026gt;...\u0026lt;/svg\u0026gt; You can also specify the rel attribute for the link. By default, the attribute value is \u0026quot;noopener noreferrer\u0026quot;. You can remove the attribute completely by setting its value to false.\n[[Params.widgets.social.custom]] title = \u0026#34;My Home Page\u0026#34; url = \u0026#34;https://example.com\u0026#34; rel = \u0026#34;me\u0026#34; [[Params.widgets.social.custom]] title = \u0026#34;Youtube\u0026#34; url = \u0026#34;https://youtube.com/user/username\u0026#34; rel = false Search box widget The search box widget can refer to the results of Google, Bing, and DuckDuckGo searches. By default, Mainroad uses Google search if no additional configuration options are specified.\nTo use a different search engine, first of all, check that the search widget is enabled. Then set the search parameters (Site.Params.widgets.search section) according to the data below.\nGoogle (default):\n[Params.widgets.search] url = \u0026#34;https://google.com/search\u0026#34; [Params.widgets.search.input] name = \u0026#34;sitesearch\u0026#34; pre = \u0026#34;\u0026#34; DuckDuckGo:\n[Params.widgets.search] url = \u0026#34;https://duckduckgo.com/\u0026#34; [Params.widgets.search.input] name = \u0026#34;sites\u0026#34; pre = \u0026#34;\u0026#34; Bing:\n[Params.widgets.search] url = \u0026#34;https://www.bing.com/search\u0026#34; [Params.widgets.search.input] name = \u0026#34;q1\u0026#34; pre = \u0026#34;site:\u0026#34; Google PSE:\n[Params.widgets.search] url = \u0026#34;/search/\u0026#34; [Params.widgets.search.input] name = false pre = \u0026#34;\u0026#34; Note that Google PSE requires additional steps to work correctly. See Creating a Programmable Search Engine and especially our FAQ for more instructions.\nMenus Mainroad supports multiple menus. The main menu is fully responsive and displayed right under the site header. The secondary menus side and footer are displayed in a sidebar widget and the page footer respectively. To add a page to a menu, add a menu: \u0026lt;menu\u0026gt; parameter to the page\u0026rsquo;s front matter:\nmenu: main # Add page to a main menu Note: Don\u0026rsquo;t forget to enable the sidemenu widget in the widgets configuration param if you want to use the side menu.\nYou can also add a page to multiple menus by providing a list:\n# Add page to a main, side, and footer menu menu: - main - side - footer Note: Please keep in mind that Mainroad menus don\u0026rsquo;t support nested items i.e. submenus.\nSee Menus from official Hugo documentation for more info.\nCustom Google Fonts support Mainroad uses Open Sans from Google Fonts as a main font. But you can use any other font from Google Fonts if you\u0026rsquo;d like. Beware, in most cases, such changes require manual CSS adjustment because every set of fonts is different and might not look as good as our default font.\nFollow the procedure below.\nOpen Google Fonts, choose font(s) that you prefer and copy href font link. For this particular example, we choose Roboto with 3 different styles. Our href font link:\nhttps://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Roboto:ital,wght@0,400;0,700;1,400\u0026amp;display=swap Set googleFontsLink site\u0026rsquo;s config param value to your href font link. For example:\n[Params] googleFontsLink = \u0026#34;https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Roboto:ital,wght@0,400;0,700;1,400\u0026amp;display=swap\u0026#34; Override default font-family set(s):\n[Params.style.vars] fontFamilyPrimary = \u0026#34;\u0026#39;Roboto\u0026#39;, sans-serif\u0026#34; It is possible to disable Google Fonts and use system font stack instead.\nDisable Google Fonts include. Set googleFontsLink site\u0026rsquo;s config param value to false:\n[Params] googleFontsLink = false Override font-family sets:\n[Params.style.vars] # Override font-family sets. Take care of different quotes OR escaping symbols in these params if necessary fontFamilyPrimary = \u0026#34;system-ui, -apple-system, \u0026#39;Segoe UI\u0026#39;, Roboto, \u0026#39;Helvetica Neue\u0026#39;, Arial, \u0026#39;Noto Sans\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Liberation Sans\u0026#39;, sans-serif, \u0026#39;Apple Color Emoji\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Segoe UI Emoji\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Segoe UI Symbol\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Noto Color Emoji\u0026#39;\u0026#34; # Secondary font-family set responsible for pre, code, kbd, and samp tags font fontFamilySecondary = \u0026#34;SFMono-Regular, Menlo, Monaco, Consolas, \u0026#39;Liberation Mono\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Courier New\u0026#39;, monospace\u0026#34; Edit this page on GitHub\n","permalink":"https://ellielife.github.io/docs/customization/","tags":null,"title":"Customization"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Browse this FAQ page to find answers to frequently asked questions that have not been covered elsewhere in the documentation.\nThe answers have been categorized into two groups:\nAnswers to general questions without any lines of code. Answers to technical questions with code snippets, step-by-step instructions, etc. General questions Do I need to have prior experience before proceeding with the Mainroad theme? Yes. You\u0026rsquo;ll need to be familiar with Hugo before proceeding. Our docs section is intended for intermediate to advanced users and developers. Our documentation may still be helpful to users with minimal experience, but are not comprehensive.\nDo I need to use the extended version of Hugo? No. Mainroad theme intentionally does not use any features of the extended version. As such, the extended version of Hugo is not required (but applicable).\nIs there a list of all possible configuration options? Configuration:\nSee All Configuration Settings for the full list of Hugo-defined variables with their default values. See Mainroad config.toml example for the full list of Mainroad-specific variables. Front Matter:\nSee Front Matter Variables for the list of Hugo-defined Front Matter variables. See Mainroad Front Matter example for the list of Mainroad-specific Front Matter variables. What if I have more questions? Should I create an issue? We don\u0026rsquo;t provide personal technical support. As stated in our contributing guidelines, please do not use the issue tracker for personal support. This includes reports like: “How do I do this\u0026quot;, “Everything is broken; help me”, “I changed something, and it doesn\u0026rsquo;t work anymore”, “It\u0026rsquo;s not a personal issue, but I just want to ask how X or Y works”, “I forked your theme, then something broke; fix this immediately”, and so on.\nThe issue tracker should only be used for bug reports, feature requests, and discussions that comply with our contributing rules. All other issues will be closed and marked as invalid.\nTechnical questions I want to get the favicon.ico and apple-touch-icon.png to match my hightlightColor. What should I do? There is no way to do this on the fly with Hugo, but you can use the one-liners below with some preparations:\nCopy: ./themes/mainroad/static/favicon.ico to ./static/favicon.ico ./themes/mainroad/static/apple-touch-icon.png to ./static/apple-touch-icon.png At the beginning of each script, replace the color in the variable with your preferred color. You must use six-digit hex triplet notation (e.g., #E22D30) to make it work properly. Go to the root of your project directory in the terminal and execute these two commands accordingly.\na=#E22D30;a=\\\\x${a:5:2}\\\\x${a:3:2}\\\\x${a:1:2};for i in 98 274 578;do printf $a|dd of=static/favicon.ico bs=1 seek=$i conv=notrunc;done a=#E22D30;a=$(echo 504C54452A2A2A${a:1:6}|sed -e \u0026#39;s/../\\\\x\u0026amp;/g\u0026#39;);printf $a|gzip|tail -c8|od -tx4 -N4 -An|xargs|sed -e \u0026#39;s/../\\\\x\u0026amp;/g\u0026#39;|printf $a$(cat -)|dd of=static/apple-touch-icon.png bs=1 seek=37 conv=notrunc I want to use Google Programmable Search Engine as a site search engine.
